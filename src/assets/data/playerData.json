      "bio": "A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after leading India to glory in the Under-19 World Cup at Kuala Lumpur in early 2008. In an Indian team filled with saint-like icons worthy of their own hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his most un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Grind through the ranks</b> <br/>  <br/> He soon joined the senior Men in Blue in Sri Lanka, come August 2008. In the absence of the regular openers, Virat Kohli was given a chance to open the batting in the ODI series. He played some commendable knocks in his extended run as an opener, as India went on to win the ODI series. However, the established and formidable pair of Tendulkar and Sehwag kept Kohli out of the team  <br/>  <br/> The 20-year-old continued to impress for Delhi and dominated attacks, clearly demonstrating that he belonged at a much higher level; that junior cricket was beneath his standards. Kohli then traveled to Australia in 2009 for the Emerging players tournament and stamped his authority all over the bowling attacks. He added 'big-match temperament' to his résumé too, lacing a fluent hundred in the final against South Africa, and guiding his team to a clinical victory. The young prodigy, barely old enough to receive his man-of-the-match champagne, ended the tournament with 398 runs from 7 outings with two centuries and two fifties, ensuring that he remained fresh in the selectors' minds.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Cementing a national spot</b> <br/>  <br/> The selectors had no choice but to give Kohli another go in the Indian side, and this time he strung together a number of impressive scores. After being given an extended run, he repaid their faith by notching up his maiden ODI hundred in an impressive run-chase against Sri Lanka in December 2009 - his first of many exemplary knocks in run-chases. In the World Cup final of 2011, the biggest stage of them all, Kohli, along with his Delhi teammate Gautam Gambhir, pulled off a largely underrated rescue effort with an 83-run stand after losing the openers early. This knock played a crucial role in setting the platform for MS Dhoni's fabled knock of 91*, which eventually won India the World Cup on that enchanting evening in Mumbai.  <br/>  <br/> In the hangover of the World Cup euphoria, Kohli continued to take giant strides in the limited-overs format. Three years after his ODI debut, he was finally handed the coveted Test cap in the Caribbean islands in July 2011, owing to the need to rest the senior players. After a series each against the Dukes ball and the SG ball, it was now time for his trial against the Kookaburra Down Under. In the first two Tests, he seemed to lack the technique to play in Australia, maintaining his low stance on the bouncy tracks. He also had a rather restricting trigger movement with his front-foot routinely coming across towards off-stump, thereby hindering the necessary movement to play back-foot shots such as the pull and the cut.  <br/>  <br/> <b>A baptism by fire Down Under</b> <br/>  <br/> The selectors and the captain persisted with him going into the 3rd Test, and he delivered a break-through performance on a bouncy Perth wicket - an impressive 75 - where a visible change in technique was visible. He managed to stand tall, with a more open stance, and exhibited the back-foot shots in his repertoire during the course of the innings. The volatile Kohli managed to overshadow his impropriety in conduct with his performance in the final Test of the series. Notching up India's only century of a disastrous tour, Kohli was the shining light in amidst the chaos, as he stroked his way to a hundred in Adelaide exhibiting the will to improve and extraordinary focus under pressure in the searing heat and pressure of Australia. <br/>  <br/> While he grappled and clawed his way into the Test side, he went on a record-breaking spree in ODIs: the Indian record for the fastest to multiples-of-thousand runs in ODIs, culminating in the world record for the fastest to 9000 runs in ODIs. He was also the highest run-scorer for India in ODIs for three consecutive calendar years - 2010, 2011 and 2012 and won the ICC ODI cricketer of the year award in 2012.  <br/>  <br/> <b>That break-through innings…</b> <br/>  <br/> We remember the accolades, but where did it all begin? There's always the one innings that made the world sit up and take notice; the 86-ball knock which he started off as a brash boy, but ended as a man. Chasing an improbable target of 321 off 40 overs to stay alive in the tournament, he laid into the Sri Lankan bowlers and carted his way to 133*, getting India home with more than 2 overs to spare, practically pulling them out of the airport after M.S. Dhoni rather ignorantly remarked that India had already been eliminated from the tournament.  <br/>  <br/> King Kohli had arrived. The king of the run-chase, and a plethora of ODI records in the modern age. <br/>  <br/> <b>Batting technique and idiosyncrasies</b> <br/>  <br/> Kohli has a seemingly hot head on his shoulders, but he channels all his anger while he is batting. Known to be an aggressive batsman always on the lookout for runs, he has a fairly sound , albeit slightly unconventional technique, which makes him judge the length of the ball earlier than most, and amazingly quick wrists to run his hands through the ball, even against fast bowlers. He is equally adept against pace and spin, and never looks ungainly at the crease. With nimble foot-movement against the spinners, he is known to be quite destructive when the situation demands it. He has had to fill some rather big shoes of his predecessors, and has done an admirable job to say the least.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Captaincy and a change in technique</b> <br/>  <br/> With regular captain MS Dhoni ailing from an injury, Kohli was named stand-in captain for the first Test at Adelaide. After an abysmal tour of England, critics were sceptical of Kohli's performance in Australia in the Border-Gavaskar trophy in December. Kohli proved that they couldn't have been more wrong, as he scored two fluent hundreds in the first Test at Adelaide. His second innings masterclass of 141 almost pulled off a stunning run-chase on a notorious 5th day rank-turner, and went on to score a total of four hundreds on this tour. Saying that he had silenced critics would be an understatement. <br/>  <br/> As India prepared for their title defence ahead of the 2015 World Cup Down Under, with the catch phrase 'Won't give it back' doing the rounds, Virat Kohli was touted to be a key performer for India. The Indians had a terrible run in Australia, having failed to win a single match in the Test series as well as the succeeding ODI tri-series. Kohli started off in signature fashion, with a typically stroke-filled hundred against Pakistan as India maintained their unbeaten run against their arch-rivals in ICC events. As India stormed into the semi-finals unbeaten, Kohli's form continued to take an uncharacteristic dip, culminating in a painstaking 1 in the semi-final loss against the co-hosts and eventual champions, Australia.  <br/>  <br/> Kohli, the then full-time Test captain, toured Sri Lanka with a young side without the services of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, wary of the Sri Lankan spinners' fabled 4th innings con-job. After losing the first Test, Kohli's India recorded a dramatic come-from-behind win in the series, going on to win 2-1. Kohli continued to build on his auspicious start to Test captaincy as he led them to a rout of the South Africans on a series of rank-turners all around India. He had a quiet series with the bat, as the more stoic batsmen of his team took over. Nonetheless, the triumph took India to the No. 1 spot in the ICC Test rankings for the first time since they forfeited it to England after the forgettable white-wash in 2011.  <br/>  <br/> He continued his emphatic run in T20 cricket (and running) like a man possessed though, thrashing boundaries with ridiculous ease. Despite an 89* in the 2016  semi-final against the West Indies (extending his inhuman run of form in the format), India's bowling panicked at a crucial stage. One had to feel sorry for him as he had to make do with the 'Player of the tournament' award for the second successive Twenty20 World Cup; a distinction he would've gladly exchanged for the elusive World T20 trophy. Kohli's thirst for runs showed no signs of slowing down as he looted a small matter of 973 runs during the 2016 edition of the Indian Premier League, the most (by far) by any batsman in the history of the tournament - as he led his Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) franchise to a runners-up finish.  <br/>  <br/> However, it isn't beyond Kohli to prove his critics wrong yet again, as he continues to take criticism on his stride, setting new standards for modern batsmanship. And as a captain, he had his ups and downs, marred with a bit of controversy towards the end of his tenure. Kohli also became the first Indian, as well as the first Asian captain, to return victorious from Down Under when India won the 4-match Test series 2-1 (2018-19). Under Kohli, India also emerged as the number one Test side for five successive years (2016-2021). <br/>  <br/> <b>The final frontier</b> <br/>  <br/> In the first week of 2018, Kohli went on to lead India in South Africa, a few weeks after he tied the knot with Indian actress and long-time girlfriend, Anushka Sharma. India went on to concede the series in the first two Tests, but came back to win the third Test match on a difficult wicket. In a series full of difficult wickets, Kohli exhibited tighter technique than he had in England, and batted better than he did in his more prolific tour of South Africa in 2013/14. Kohli went on to conquer his (personal) final frontier in England later in 2018 too, scoring 593 runs in 10 innings, including 2 hundreds, and not conceding his wicket to his fabled nemesis, Anderson, even once. India went on to lose the series 1-4, and Kohli's record as captain was tainted by two consecutive Test series losses away.  <br/>  <br/> Nevertheless, on a personal level, he had left no stone unturned to transform himself into the most consistent and versatile batsman of his age, and arguably the better of the Big Four. In October 2018, during the second of 3 consecutive hundreds against the West Indies in ODIs, he went on to become the fastest batsmen to reach the 10,000-run mark in ODIs, trouncing Sachin Tendulkar by a staggering 54 innings. Despite arguments about the two new balls, better bats, batting-friendly conditions, and more lethal bowlers, it was difficult to deny that this was a statistical outlier, very much along the lines of 99.94 - perhaps unlikely to ever be trounced.   <br/>  <br/> However, being a cricket romantic (as we all are), as we reflect on his prolific international career (and with a plethora of records to be broken over the next decade) one must look back at the CB series knock that changed it all. On that fateful night at Hobart, Kohli had not only kept his team in contention, he had actually dragged a drained Indian side out of the airport. That night, at the Bellerive Oval, Virat Kohli transcended into a league of his own to etch his name in history - and a cricketing superstar was born. <br/>  <br/> <b>A slump in form</b> <br/> In 2020 came the pandemic, and along with that an unexpected slump in form for Virat Kohli. He has a poor IPL season in 2020 and 2021, and his International records also weren’t very flattering. From April 2019 to September, 2022, Virat Kohli didn’t score a single International century. He seemed to be faltering against spin, particularly in home Test matches and has often spoken publicly about this being the lowest phase of his life.  <br/>  <br/> In this same phase, Virat Kohli stepped down as the T20I captain after the 2021 World Cup, where India suffered a group stage exit. He has asked to relinquish the ODI captaincy as well, with Rohit Sharma being named as his successor. A few months later, after a series defeat away to South Africa, Virat Kohli decided to step down as Test captain as well, with Rohit Sharma being named as his successor once again.  <br/>  <br/> <b>The redemption arc</b> <br/> Form is temporary, class is permanent. While there were a few murmured calls to drop Kohli during this challenging phase, he kept his place in the Indian team across formats and eventually silenced his critics. In September, 2022, Virat Kohli finally broke his four year jinx and got a century against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup. He carried that form into the 2022 T20 World Cup, where he played an unreal knock in the group stages against Pakistan, giving India an unlikely win over their rivals, glamourised by that straight six off Haris Rauf’s bowling. While India lost in the semi-finals, Kohli ended the tournament as India’s leading run scorer.  <br/>  <br/> Kohli carried that form onto the next year as well, where he played a few match winning knocks against Australia and South Africa in the build-up to the 2023 ODI World Cup. He also scored a century against Pakistan in the Asia Cup as India picked up a formidable win. Kohli elevated his game once again at that World Cup, as he got centuries against Bangladesh and South Africa in the group stages, to add to four fifties as well.  <br/>  <br/> In the semi-final against New Zealand, Kohli overtook Sachin Tendulkar as he became the first player in history to score 50 ODI hundreds. India lost out to Australia in the semi-final, but Kohli was named player of the tournament for his incredible performances that saw him score 765 runs at an average of 95.63.  <br/>  <br/> Post the World Cup defeat, Kohli took a bit of a break from the game for personal reasons. However, he came roaring back in the 2024 IPL as he ended with the Orange Cap. Owing to his form, he was expected to be India’s marquee man at the 2024 T20 World Cup, which started a couple of weeks after the culmination of the IPL.  <br/>  <br/> Kohli though surprisingly struggled through the group stages of that tournament, as he failed to register even a single fifty. However, he had saved his best for the big occasion as he stepped up in the final against South Africa, top scoring for India with 76. His efforts ensured that India won a thrilling final, ending a 11 year trophy jinx. After that World Cup triumph, Virat Kohli announced his retirement from T20I cricket.  <br/>  <br/> Virat Kohli faced a bit of a slump once again post the World Cup success, as he had an underwhelming ODI tour to Sri Lanka, and struggled in the home Tests against New Zealand as well, as India suffered a 3-0 whitewash at the hands of the Kiwis. Next up after that debilitating series loss was a tour to Australia, where Kohli showed his mantle once again with a sensational century at Perth, as India won the first Test.  <br/>  <br/> Unfortunately, Kohli and the rest of the team struggled post that Test, as India went down 3-1 against Australia, ending their chances of qualifying for the Test championship final.  <br/>  <br/> After this disappointment Down Under, India turned their attention towards the 2025 Champions Trophy. Kohli found his mojo once again in his most preferred ODI format, as he scored a century against Pakistan and a fifty against Australia as India claimed a second ICC trophy in a span of 9 months.  <br/>  <br/> In May, 2025, Virat Kohli unexpectedly announced his retirement from Test cricket, following suit from teammate Rohit Sharma who decided to step down a few days earlier. Kohli drew the curtains on an illustrious Test career that saw his score 9230 runs at an average of 46.85.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> Ahead of the 2019 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), Virat Kohli showed how much faith he had in the franchise by declaring that he would perhaps end his career with the Bangalore-based Royal Challengers. The only player to be a part of a single franchise for the entire duration of the tournament (right from the start of the cash-rich league in 2008), Kohli has developed an affection with the franchise and with the fans over the period of time.  <br/>  <br/> Having been brought into the franchise as a young emerging player in 2008, Kohli's growth has been stupendous. He learnt under the wings of Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble, before finally establishing himself under Daniel Vettori. It wasn't a free-flowing start, in a team that was struggling to find the essence of the tournament, it wasn't a surprise that they had a struggling youngster in the midst. Having learnt the ropes in the first three-year cycle, it wasn't a surprise that he was the only player retained in 2011. The purple patch began somewhere around that region, he then proved it wasn't just a purple patch, it was a career that was beginning to flourish. Soon after, Kohli became the best in all aspects, not just white-ball cricket, but in the red-ball version as well. <br/>  <br/> It became a no-brainer when he was asked to captain the Bangalore franchise on a permanent basis from 2012 and it also translated into more consistency with the bat. Kohli soon turned into a fan favourite even as runs flowed from his bat and eventually becoming the leading-run scorer in the history of IPL. Circa, 2016 - the India and RCB captain blasted 973 runs - the most by any player in the history of the game and it included four hundreds - the most by a batsman in a single edition.  Alas, all this didn't translate into a title triumph - one that has kept Kohli and Bangalore waiting so far (As of March 2023). <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Rishi Roy</b>",

      "bio": "Talent – an apparently heartening term that has followed Rohit Sharma around like a shadow; even haunted him at times. It seems to be a burden that the cricketing fraternity has enforced upon him and, after more than a decade in the national setting, he has been weighed down by the label.  <br/>  <br/> Harsha Bhogle spoke of whispers in the domestic circuit; of coaches and scouts spotting the effortless, free-flowing stroke-play of a Mumbai teenager. Having cruised through first-class cricket, with an average well above 50, he shot to the limelight when he scored a brisk unbeaten triple-hundred at the Ranji level. <br/>  <br/> It all began after an injury to an in-form Yuvraj Singh in the 2007 World T20, when Rohit was called upon as a last-minute emergency replacement to play a league game against the hosts. After a lacklustre start to the Indian innings, the 20-year-old strode out into Kingsmead and stroked his way to a fluent half-century against the likes of Pollock, Ntini and Morkel as though he were having a net session. He showed startling maturity under pressure to survive till the end of the innings, escorting India to a respectable total that they ultimately defended, knocking South Africa out of the tournament in their own backyard. <br/>  <br/> Indian cricket-frenzy fans have a thing for like-for-like replacements. More specifically, they have a thing for spotting similarities with the days gone by. With an incessant obsession for stats, there lies a cricketing romantic who is struck by nostalgia when manifested with the idea of an elegant-looking batsman with free-flowing batting style from Mumbai. That's right – Rohit Sharma was touted to be the Great Sachin Tendulkar's long-destined successor at number 4 in the Test batting line-up. After all, it added up: so much time to play his shots, effortless stroke-making capabilities even against express pace, and a wide repertoire of shots. This had to be God's gift to cricket in the post-Tendulkar era, right? <br/>  <br/> Rohit was subsequently picked for the ODI team on a selection whim after his burst of vital performances in the World T20 and his impressive Ranji Trophy record. He made an impression in the CB series Down Under, playing some crucial cameos against stalwarts like Brett Lee and Stuart Clark, and a more-than-competent Sri Lankan attack. These inspired away performances in the World T20 and the CB series caught the eye of the selectors, and warranted him an extended run with the limited-overs side. <br/>  <br/> However, inconsistency and a knack of gifting his wicket away meant that he struggled to cement his spot in the side. Critics pointed out that he had too many shots for the same ball, and this meant that shot selection was becoming a bit of an issue for him. Furthermore, several experts spotted that he had trouble playing the short ball since his stance was too side-on and that he had no back-and-across trigger movement. His pedestrian batting average of 22 to go with a string of low scores and unconverted starts meant that he failed to cement a spot in the side for the 2011 Cricket World Cup squad...  <br/>  <br/> Looking back at his career, Rohit Sharma would have the Indian Premier League to thank for keeping him in the reckoning and not being discarded liked several other young and talented cricketers who burst forth into national reckoning but couldn't make it big at the highest level. In the first two years of the IPL, his performance stood out, as he made over 350 runs each time for the Deccan Chargers and proved his worth to his franchise. He was then transferred to the Mumbai Indians franchise in 2011 and has been one of their most consistent batsmen over the years. <br/>  <br/> Rohit continued to oscillate in and out of the Indian eleven without being able to establish himself in the side, having been given ample opportunities despite a well-established Indian middle-order. Alas, after making it to the Playing XI for the Nagpur Test against South Africa in 2010, he was lamentably injured in a warm-up football game after coming heart-breakingly close to receiving the coveted India cap. He was subsequently ruled out of the series in a gut-wrenching turn of events, and wouldn't get another opportunity to prove his Test credentials for another 4 years. <br/>  <br/> Rohit's proved himself on the IPL stage again in 2011 and made a comeback into the ODI squad for the tour of West Indies where he scored three half-centuries in five matches. However, this turned out to be another false dawn as he followed it up with a string of low scores in the CB series in Australia and a nightmare tour of Sri Lanka with just 14 runs from 5 innings, including 2 ducks. He had already been given a more-than-extended run and was starting to build an unenviable reputation of a frustratingly fascinating player.  <br/>  <br/> The generally fickle selectors, surprisingly, continued to back him. Eventually, due to lack of contenders for the opener's spot in ODIs, MS Dhoni, the Indian captain, decided to try him as an opener in the limited-overs' format.  <br/>  <br/> The term 'masterstroke' has always been a bit of an enigma, historically being used in a vague, result-based manner. The move to promote Rohit Sharma to the top of the order has paid enough dividends for it to be termed a masterstroke – India had finally found a candidate for the opener's spot, and Rohit seemed to have finally scripted a turnaround after almost 5 years in and out of the side. With enough time to play himself in as an opener, Rohit and Dhawan formed a formidable opening partnership, playing a substantial role in India's unbeaten and successful Champions' Trophy campaign in 2013. Still, the talented tag followed him around, and Rohit – at long last – started to live up to it. In a run-fest of an ODI series against Australia, Rohit scored 491 runs in 6 outings, culminating in a violent 209 in the deciding ODI in Bangalore, joining a crème de la crème list of ODI double-centurions that comprised of Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag. <br/>  <br/> With the retirements of stalwarts like Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman, a new crop of Test batsmen needed to be honed, and opened up new avenues in the team. Rohit, at long last, earned the oh-so-desirable India Test cap against West Indies in the first Test at the Eden Gardens in his fabled 'predecessor's' farewell series. Rohit wasn't going to let this opportunity go begging and embraced the Test arena immediately, easing his way to a typically Rohit-esque 177 in his debut innings; a vital innings in the context of the match, dragging the momentum India's way. He reinforced his metaphorical statement to the selectors with an unbeaten 111 in the following Test, enchanting a tearful Wankhede in Sachin Tendulkar's farewell Test match and taming the West Indian bowling attack. After an injury-break, Rohit, as if to make up for lost time, ripped apart a hapless Sri Lankan attack on his way to a jaw-dropping 264 – wait for it – <i>in an ODI</i> at the Eden Gardens, making thirteen runs more than the entire Lankan team managed.  <br/>  <br/> However, a worrying trend continued after the selectors picked him for the tour to Australia after his Kolkata epic: that of getting picked for away Test tours based on white ball performances in less testing conditions. He was picked after his 209 for the South Africa tour in late 2013 and looked technically inept in seaming conditions, committing to the line of the ball too early and playing as if it were a true wicket. His strength of picking the length early in ODIs was turning into a curse in Test matches. Similarly, having been picked for the tour of Australia on the back of his 264, he made just one fifty in 6 innings, looking completely at sea against the pace-heavy Australian attack, continuously playing away from the body, trying to hit through the line in conditions conducive to lateral movement and showing poor off-stump awareness.  <br/>  <br/> Nevertheless he continued his golden run in ODIs, ending the 2015 World Cup campaign as India's second-highest run-scorer with a total of 330 runs, including a hundred in the quarter-final against Bangladesh to go with two fifties. <br/>  <br/> Rohit, the ODI player, finally delivered a break-through performance as an opener with an impeccable limited-overs tour of Australia in early 2016, making back-to-back hundreds and a 99 in the series and finally answering the faith of the selectors and his captain. He had become a one-day monster who developed a habit - started his ODI innings in a slow and steady manner, but could really lay into any bowling attack once he was in. With an extended home season, Rohit continued to get chances in Tests and showed vast improvement in his technique, playing closer to his body and preventing his ODI game to amalgamate with his more air-tight Test technique. With four fifties and a hundred in his last 5 innings, he capped off a fruitful home season with an unprecedented third ODI double-century against a woebegone Sri Lankan attack.  <br/>  <br/> With gifted technique and languid elegance as his allies, Rohit found a route to consistency and has been a regular feature in the Test set-up since 2018. His white-ball, prowess, however witnessed yet another high in 2019 as he ended up as the highest run-getter in the ODI World Cup in England with 648 runs from 9 games at an average of 81 that included 67 fours and 14 sixes. Just over a month ahead of the 2021 T20 World Cup, Virat Kohli stepped down as T20I captain, and there were no qualms about who the next skipper was going to be, with Rohit Sharma being the ultimate favourite. A couple of months later, BCCI named Rohit as the ODI skipper for the tour of South Africa 2021-22. Having missed the entire tour due to injury, Rohit assumed the full-time captaincy in India's 1000th ODI in Ahmedabad (vs West Indies on 06 February 2022). A couple of weeks later, and on expected lines, Rohit took over the Test captaincy from Kohli and led India to series wins over Sri Lanka and Bangladesh (drew series with England in England 2021-22) thus far (As of March 2023). <br/>  <br/> Rohit was India’s skipper in the 2022 T20I World Cup, where his team was brutally outplayed by England in the semi-final. Post that defeat, he took the mantle on himself to change the team culture and instill a brand of fearless cricket amongst his boys. Rohit led from the front in the 2023 ODI World Cup, giving the team blazing starts in most games. He scored quick runs without caring too much for personal records as India cruised through to the finals, unbeaten. They were unfortunately beaten in the final by Australia. <br/>  <br/> Rohit Sharma got his chance at redemption though a few months later in the T20I World Cup. He was instrumental for India in a group game against Australia and then in the semi-final against England where he scored big runs to drive the opposition out of the game. It was under his captaincy that India eventually managed to break their 11 year trophy jinx as they won the 2024 T20I World Cup in Barbados. Rohit Sharma subsequently retired from T20Is after winning the World Cup. Post the World Cup, Rohit had a bit of a slump in form, especially in Test cricket as India suffered a 3-0 home whitewash at the hands of New Zealand and then lost the Border Gavaskar Series as well. He famously dropped himself from the side despite being skipper for the final Sydney Test of the BGT. <br/>  <br/> Rohit found form once again when white ball cricket resumed, as he scored a superb hundred against England in a home bilateral series. He followed that form into the Champions Trophy, reserving his best for the final where he top scored for India to claim the Man of the Match and also lead the team to a second ICC trophy in the span of nine months. <br/>  <br/> In April, 2025, while still the captain of the Test team, Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from Test cricket, drawing the curtains on a career that spanned 12 years.      <br/>  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> The IPL has done a lot for Rohit Sharma. When he was a young, talented batsman who struggled with consistency, the IPL gave him a ticket to stay relevant, and he grabbed it with both hands during his time with the Deccan Chargers from 2008-2010, scoring over 350 runs in each of the three seasons. Then the IPL took him back to his home of Mumbai, and Rohit couldn't have been happier. His statistics with the Mumbai Indians got progressively better from 2011-13, and eventually his best IPL season in 2013 - where he finished the tournament with 538 runs - coincided with MI's maiden title win.  <br/>  <br/> And finally, the IPL helped unveil a leadership side to Rohit Sharma that has impressed a lot of people. Rohit led MI to five IPL titles which is an amazing accomplishment.  Rohit is also among the all-time top run-scorers in the IPL, only behind Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan. <br/>  <br/> In 2024, Rohit was removed as captain by Mumbai Indians with a returning Hardik Pandya taking over captaincy after being transferred in from Gujarat Titans. Rohit Sharma was retained by the franchise ahead of the mega auction for IPL 2025.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Rishi Roy</b> and <b>Saurabh Shankar</b>",

      "bio": "Less than thirty years before that enchanting Saturday night when Ravi Shastri’s voice rang through television sets all over India, when even the spunky and exuberant Indian youth showed more interest in an old-school CRT television at a local <i>chai ki dukaan</i> than the dance-floor at a pub, a pump-operator in Ranchi awaited the birth of his third child.  <br/>  <br/> <BLOCKQUOTE>'Dhoniiiii finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into the crowd. India lift the World Cup after 28 years. The party's started in the dressing room. And it’s an Indian captain, who’s been absolutely magnificent, in the night of the final.’</BLOCKQUOTE>  <br/>  <br/> Any cricket fan worth his salt just read this in Ravi Shastri's most dramatic voice, as Mahendra Singh Dhoni enchanted the Wankhede on the night of 2nd April 2011. <br/>  <br/> <b>The Foundations</b> <br/>  <br/> Hailing from Jharkhand, Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s rise through the ranks into international cricket is a tale of rebellion, extraordinary merit, perseverance, and, most of all, belief. After being scouted on the whims of his school P.E. teacher as a wicketkeeper, Dhoni created whispers in the cricketing circles of Ranchi - a teenage boy with no measurable upper-body strength clearing boundaries against some of the best fast bowlers of the district. However, the system failed him as he found it difficult to make the cut against candidates of the more affluent A-tier states. Consequently, in a desperate move, he joined the Railways Ranji team and started to work as a ticket collector at the Kharagpur railway station to make ends meet. <br/>  <br/> Nevertheless, in a few months, the stars started to align themselves for the precocious wunderkind from Ranchi. Inspired by the KSCA, the BCCI started a country-wide Training Research Development Wing to scout talent from the more financially backward states. Dhoni immediately caught the eyes of the scouts and was sent on an A tour to Kenya, where his talent burst forth for the world to see as he showcased his batting pyrotechnics against world-class bowlers in alien conditions. He immediately shot to national reckoning and was selected for the tour of Bangladesh in November 2004.  <br/>  <br/> By then a broad 22-year-old with long locks, Dhoni’s India career got off to an inauspicious start, as he scored a duck in his first ODI and a string of low scores followed. However, the selectors and the then-captain Sourav Ganguly decided to persist with him and gave him an extended run. Dhoni repaid their faith with an exhibition of his charisma and audacious stroke-play in his fifth ODI against Pakistan, who certainly didn’t see the butchery coming, as he butchered his way to 148 at Vishakhapatnam. Later in 2005, he went one step further bludgeoning his way to a brutal 183* in Jaipur to make a mockery of a 300-run chase against a Sri Lankan attack that looked aghast at his bizarre-but-effective stroke-play and the unparalleled physical power that he imparted on the ball.  <br/>  <br/> As teams all over the world tried to work a way around his fireworks, Dhoni established himself as a reliable batsman in Tests too, with a technique that worked against pace, seam, swing and spin. In his 5th Test, he coincidentally scored another 148 against Pakistan in an uncharacteristically stoic effort to save the match, thereby portraying his versatility as a batsman. After a string of wicketkeeper-batsmen being tried in the side, Dhoni had finally become a mainstay in the side - a powerful pinch-hitter towards the end of the innings capable of more than just cameos, and a more-than-reliable wicketkeeper in the side.  <br/>  <br/> In a state where leather ball cricket was a luxury, Dhoni grew up playing tennis ball cricket tournaments. With heavy Kashmir willow bats, light and hollow tennis balls, and long boundaries, he developed a bottomhand-dominated technique to impart maximum power on the light tennis ball which undergoes energy-damping upon impact. However, Dhoni stood out when he, along with a friend, developed an elevated body-weight shot with an exaggerated follow-through that cleared boundaries with ease. On that count, cricketing folklore will remember MS Dhoni as the man who had the audacity to play the 'helicopter shot' against the leather ball. <br/>  <br/> <b>Captaincy</b> <br/>  <br/> With a mature head on his shoulders and an astute and shrewd cricketing mind, Dhoni was recommended by senior players like Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid for captaincy after Rahul Dravid stepped down as skipper.  <br/>  <br/> On his first assignment in the inaugural World T20 in 2007, Dhoni and his young troops romped to the title in a shock victory for the inexperienced Indian side, bringing about the T20 revolution in India. Dhoni's calm and composed leadership was widely lauded in the cricketing fraternity after India brought the trophy home, earning him the label of ‘Captain Cool’. He was soon handed the ODI leadership as a natural move after his World T20 triumph, and after the retirement of Anil Kumble in late 2008, the Test leadership was thrust upon him too. <br/>  <br/> Dhoni had a golden run as captain, with an unbeaten run in Test series since his captaincy debut, leading them to their first stint as the top-ranked Test team in the world. His winning streak included the home series against Australia in 2008, a 1-0 triumph in New Zealand in 2009, and a 2-0 victory against Sri Lanka at home, culminating in a comprehensive win at the Brabourne stadium, Mumbai, where he received the coveted Test Championship mace. India continued to dominate in home Tests after this and drew a series in South Africa, coming very close to their maiden series win in South Africa in  the decider in Cape Town, where some stoic resistance by the hosts narrowly saved them from the a defeat at the hands of a rampaging Indian side in top form.  <br/>  <br/> Dhoni continued to garner praise for his success across formats; especially for his clinical success in limited-overs cricket, reaching the pinnacle of his captaincy career during India's path to glory in the 2011 World Cup. Dhoni’s India knocked out Australia, the holders of the World Cup since 1999, in the quarter-final in Ahmedabad. Having gone through a patch of lackluster form throughout the tournament, Dhoni peaked at the right time, exhibiting his usual sangfroid on the way to 91* in the World Cup final against Sri Lanka, and lofted an iconic six over long-on, triggering night-long celebrations all over Mumbai and the rest of India. <br/>  <br/> <b>Transition Period - A rebuilding phase</b> <br/>  <br/> After the World Cup, the Indian team saw a difficult transition period. Dhoni's shrewd captaincy came under severe scrutiny during the 8 successive losses in England and Australia. In the aftermath of the overseas failures, which included England toppling them over as the number 1 Test side in the world, a fatigued Indian side faced a 1-2 drubbing against England at home as India's Test team hit rockbottom. The team's abysmal performances in the longer format raised serious questions about Dhoni's leadership and a whisper of his sacking; a somewhat misplaced and impulsive proposition, given the poor overall performance of the entire team, their inept technique against spin (which is their forte), an overflowing timetable, and a plethora of viable explanations. <br/>  <br/> However, the transition phase in Indian cricket saw the famed batting line-up failing to meet their lofty standards, and a rather raw bowling fast-bowling line-up with negligible experience struggling, as Zaheer Khan suffering from a long-term injury.  <br/>  <br/> There was only so much Dhoni could do... <br/>  <br/> However, after taking some tough selection calls, Dhoni led the way in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with a marathon 224 in Chennai, setting the platform for a clean-sweep of Australia at home, clinically blanking them to regain the trophy. India became the first team in more than 40 years to whitewash Australia in a Test series and Dhoni now had the most Test wins for an Indian captain under his belt. <br/>  <br/> India's poor Test form had unfortunately seeped into the ODI fold as well. However, Dhoni developed an uncanny ability to play a symbolic game of poker during run-chases, and backing himself to finish it off in the last over without blinking. He repeated this feat multiple times: whacking a 112-meter six to clear the Adelaide boundary with 12 to win off 4 in the CB series, chasing down 15 in the last over in the Celkon Cup final to name a few, and a ridiculous 23 off the last over in a run-chase off Axar Patel to win a dead-rubber in IPL 2016; with the equation at 12 to win from 2, he dropped jaws by clouting two sixes to pull off a scarcely believable victory. <br/>  <br/> He had started to build a reputation of being one of the most reliable batsmen limited-overs cricket, taking India to victory constantly from the jaws of defeat. For instance, his century batting at No.7  against Pakistan at Chennai, a stunning 113 walking into the crease when India were 29 for 5, was a knock that symbolized the leader MS Dhoni who led by example, as well as exhibited sharp tactical nous: a much sought-after combination in a captain. <br/>  <br/> <b>The Redemption</b> <br/>  <br/> After rebuilding the ODI side and phasing out the seniors, Dhoni had a fine run as captain in 2013, leading India to their second Champions Trophy triumph as they cruised to the title undefeated, providing a welcome distraction from the IPL spot-fixing controversy. This made him the first captain in history to win all three ICC global trophies, etching his name in the history books with an unprecedented record and an enviable trophy cabinet as a limited-overs captain. <br/>  <br/> He led the side to the final of the 2014 World T20 in Bangladesh, in which India lost to Sri Lanka in the final, and the semi-final of the World T20 in 2016 in India. Dhoni also is the captain of Chennai franchise, one of the most successful teams in the history of Indian Premier League, which won back-to-back titles in the years 2010 and 2011 and also the Champions League T20 in the years 2010 and 2014.  <br/>  <br/> Dhoni's Test captaincy came under severe criticism, especially after India's continuous losses overseas. Despite a Lord’s victory on a green-top in 2014, India went on to lose the three subsequent Tests in England in 2014, where Dhoni made some lone contributions, including a dogged 82 in a total of 148 and a few other fifties. He countered the seam movement and swing by playing late and walking down the pitch, showing greater application than the rest of his line-up with more orthodox techniques. Despite not having the often-talked-about hundred in overseas conditions, Dhoni has made several valuable contributions in the lower-order which have immeasurable value in the context of the game.  <br/>  <br/> <b>The beginning of the end</b> <br/>  <br/> In the away Border-Gavaskar trophy in 2014, moments after helping India draw the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne, Dhoni announced that he was stepping down from Test captaincy and retiring from Test cricket, citing excessive workload as the reason for quitting the longest format. After honing a potent bowling attack and a gritty batting line-up for his heir, and taking several body blows - literal and metaphorical - Dhoni ensured that he copped the criticism to nurture a potent team and left his successor a young, zealous team with the tenacity, fitness, and most importantly, the positive attitude to perform in all conditions. <br/>  <br/> Dhoni successfully led India to the 2015 World Cup semi-final, where the defending champions conceded cricket’s most desirable trophy to Australia. Here too, Dhoni was the lone-warrior, as he gritted his way through to 65, as his team fell short by 95 runs.  <br/>  <br/> On 4th January, 2017 Dhoni stepped down as the captain of the Indian ODI and T20I team, bringing about the end of an era in Indian cricket. Having led the team with zeal and panache across all formats of the game for more than nine years, Dhoni decided to play with the freedom of a pure batsman in his final lap of international cricket without the enormous burden of captaincy. <br/>  <br/> In 2018, with the top order of the Indian team in turbo-mode, MS Dhoni had fewer opportunities to bat and went through an alarming dip in form - the likes of which hadn't been seen since the early days of his international career. With a revised technique and a far more top-handed batting style, Dhoni reinforced his game to suit his waning reactions and wrist strength and continued to be a part of the Indian middle order, guiding younger bowlers, almost handholding the spinners in limited-overs cricket and creating dismissals out of thin air with his lightning-quick stumpings, and almost reinventing the art of wicketkeeping to spinners by eliminating the followthrough at the point of connection.  <br/>  <br/> While his chicanery behind the stumps, and the tactical nous to assist the newer leaders may have been priceless for the team, the lack of runs and the declining strike-rate were starting to stand out, leading to his exclusion from T20Is in late 2018. Despite a fantastic IPL 2018, Dhoni has struggled to make his bat do the talking in international cricket of late, as the helicopter stands rusting on the spot it was last seen. After the semifinal heartbreak of the 2019 World Cup, Dhoni did not play an international game for India. On August 15, 2020, just like catches batsmen unaware with his glovework, MS Dhoni surprised the cricketing world by announcing his international retirement through an Instagram post that read, \"Thanks a lot for ur love and support throughout.from 1929 hrs consider me as Retired.\" <br/>  <br/> The journey started with a run-out and ended with a run-out. <br/>   <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> MS Dhoni and Chennai Super Kings is a great yellove story. Ever since the Indian Premier League idea spread vigorously among the cricketing fraternity, people wondered which team would pouch the then Indian captain. The Super Kings, run by an organisation that knew the nuances of running sports, knew they wanted a strong leader to lay a strong base and they made a grand opening by bagging Dhoni for a whopping 6 Crore, the highest bid back then. The IPL would be born on April 18, 2008 and on June 1, Dhoni was there leading CSK in the final, albeit in a losing cause in a final-ball finish. <br/>  <br/> The result may not have gone his way, but he made a mark with his captaincy and by finishing as the side's second highest run-getter. CSK were stopped one step before the final in 2009, but a year later, Dhoni made a quirky move against Kieron Pollard in the final against Mumbai Indians by placing a straightish mid-off despite having a long-off to get his hands on the coveted trophy after two failed attempts. With three consistent years, Dhoni ensured the team made a big mark and they were considered the invincibles of the IPL. CSK justified the tag by winning the title in 2011 and came runners up in the following two editions.  <br/>  <br/> Dhoni was the third highest run-getter in 2013, a season where he fought a lone battle against Mumbai in the final. His team team suffered a tough loss in Qualifier 2 against a rampant Kings XI Punjab in 2014, another year where Dhoni scored in excess of 350 runs. 2015 was a black mark in CSK's history as the team was hit by the spot-fixing saga, but Dhoni led the side to the final among the ruckus, before the franchise was slapped with a two-year ban. <br/>  <br/> The ban meant all the CSK players were to spread and Dhoni moved to the newly formed Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016. He spent a quite year, but was back doing what he does best, leading his side to the final, but yet again, finished runners-up in a heart-breaking loss to the Mumbai Indians in the final. <br/>  <br/> 2018 was a grand re-entry for Dhoni and CSK. The franchise was given an unimaginably rousing welcome by the fans, who even took a train all the way from Chennai to Pune to support the team as the matches had to be moved out of Chennai. Dhoni was back to where he belonged. He looked fresher, fitter and hungrier. With his brilliant power-hitting through the season, he silenced critics who ever questioning his hitting prowess and made a strong statement that he is still well and truly alive for the 2019 World Cup. <br/>  <br/> After a heart-breaking 1-run loss in the 2019 IPL final to Mumbai, Dhoni led CSK to their 4th title in 2021. Dhoni stepped down from CSK captaincy but he got it back from Ravindra Jadeja after a disastrous 2022 season which saw them not qualify for the playoffs. Dhoni will be back for the 2023 season and will captain the side. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Rishi Roy</b>",

      "bio": "<BLOCKQUOTE>Sachiiiiiiin, Sachin!</BLOCKQUOTE> <br/> You’ve heard the chant. You may not have heard of the sport, but you’ve heard the chant. The chant - one that a billion people once lived by; one that would originate from the Wankhede and echo across the city and the seas. It is a name that continues to inspire many, not only in India, but all over the world, to take up the sport. Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar was that cricketer whose personality and aura upstaged any cricketing contest; yet he maintained that he wasn’t greater than than the game. To the people of India, the 5’5” giant of a man was much more than that. He was an emotion; a symbol of hope in a nation that revered him as nothing short of a God.  <br/>  <br/> Ironically, in the midst of the over-the-top veneration and in spite of the pedestal he has been placed on, it is his humility and the ability to cast it all out that has allowed him to put forth his best performances on the international stage for over two decades. Having played across generations, Tendulkar started playing Test cricket in a white shirt that could just as easily have been used as a school uniform, and scored his last Test hundred in a niche Nike jersey that was impossible to buy over the counter, and would later be auctioned for millions.  <br/>  <br/> <b>In a nutshell</b> <br/> In the midst of all the constant adulation he has received over a significantly transitional period for cricket, commercially and otherwise, and in a sea of statistics that every Tendulkar-centric conversation attracts, it is sometimes easy to forget that he was perhaps the most complete batsman of his generation - one who combined natural talent with hard work and dedication; one who recognized the importance of shaping and polishing the diamond. This uncommon blend of dedication and ability made him stand out in the crowd, and made him the legend that is Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar.  <br/>  <br/> Tendulkar has been the single biggest factor behind the explosion of popularity that cricket enjoys in India which led to the Indian board becoming the richest and most powerful in world cricket. In a country already predisposed to cricket, Tendulkar gave the people a hero they could look upto regardless of age, colour, creed or sect - and catapulted cricket from a sport to a religion in the subcontinent. <br/>  <br/> <b>The summit of all things cricket</b> <br/> In a game riddled with statistics, he owns almost every batting record worth owning, including that of the most runs in Test and ODI cricket, the most hundreds in the two formats, and the highest number of centuries in international cricket - a mind-numbing 100. Despite a tough start to his ODI career, Tendulkar found his calling at the top of the order when he was sent to open against New Zealand in 1994 and struck a 49-ball 82, and made the opening spot his own. He went on to compile 49 ODI hundreds by the end of his career - eclipsing the second-best by nineteen hundreds.  <br/>  <br/> <b>A World Cup veteran</b> <br/> Moreover, this career spanned over six World Cup appearances, from 1992 to 2011, in which he made two appearances in the final (2003 and 2011), finally getting his hands on the coveted trophy on that enchanting night in Mumbai on the 2nd of April 2011, getting the swan-song he deserved in front of his home crowd in Mumbai. <br/>  <br/> <BLOCKQUOTE>“He has carried the burden of the nation for 21 years; it’s time we carried him on our shoulders\"</BLOCKQUOTE> - Virat Kohli’s words after his idol Sachin Tendulkar finally got his hands on the long-awaited World Cup trophy. <br/>  <br/> Despite all the talk about Tendulkar’s failures under pressure, his performances in big events were difficult to ignore. In his two World Cup final appearances, Tendulkar flattered to deceive with scores of 4 (2003 final vs. Australia) and 18 (2011 final vs. Sri Lanka). Nevertheless, his overall performances and contributions over the course of the aforementioned tournaments played a huge part in getting India to the final in the first place. In the 2003 edition of the tournament, Tendulkar scored an astonishing 673 runs in the tournament, going past his own record of 523 runs in a World Cup tournament (1996 World Cup) - a record that still stands. Moreover, in India’s 2011 victorious World Cup campaign, he was once again India’s highest run-scorer and the second-highest overall, with 482 runs in the tournament at an average of 53.55, with 2 hundreds in the league stages (against England and South Africa) and 2 crucial fifties in the knockouts (against Australia and Pakistan).  <br/>  <br/> With a doubt, though, Tendulkar’s fondest World Cup memory remains the moment he finally received the medal he had been waiting for for the best part of two decades and a bit, and of course, the moment he got his hands on the World Cup trophy. <br/>  <br/> <b>The Initiation</b> <br/> There are so many tales about how Tendulkar was introduced to cricket, we may never know the absolute truth. According to legend, his half-brother, Ajit, with whom Sachin \"lived the dream”, took him to Sharadashram School in Mumbai and introduced him to Ramakant Acharekar, his first coach, at the age of eleven in an effort to focus his energy on something productive.  <br/>  <br/> Since then, Tendulkar’s life was Eat, Sleep, Cricket.  <br/>  <br/> He changed schools, trained hard, played truckloads of matches, and soon, the name Sachin Tendulkar was famous across Mumbai. There was a whisper, whenever he was slated to bat in a school match, as crowds gathered to watch him bat. From a tender age, he would live up to the expectations too, as he famously scored 326* in a record-breaking partnership of 664 with Vinod Kambli - the highest partnership in any form of competitive cricket at the time.  <br/>  <br/> It was only a matter of time before he was a part of the Mumbai team and made his domestic debut. However, he was certainly too young to be facing senior bowlers, and this raised several eyebrows. However, when Dilip Vengsarkar, India’s captain at the time, watched him bat against Kapil Dev in the nets, the case of the child prodigy was escalated immediately. He made his first domestic appearance at the age of 14, and struck centuries on Ranji and Duleep trophy debut. He continued to pile on the runs, and an India call-up beckoned, a couple of years later.  <br/>  <br/> <b>The teenager on a battlefield</b> <br/> After several performances of note at the domestic level, it was the popular opinion that Tendulkar was ready, at the tender age of 16, to be playing international cricket. He was picked in the Test squad to tour Pakistan in November 1989, and was slated to face some of the greatest fast bowlers of all time in their own backyard. <br/>  <br/> Ram Singh Dungarpur was said to have selected Tendulkar for the tour, and Sachin made his debut in Karachi, aged 16 years and 205 days. He was dismissed by fellow debutant Waqar Younis for 15, and by his own admission, thought he wasn’t ready for the sheer pace of the international level at the time. However, in the final Test in Sialkot, Tendulkar was hit on the nose by a Waqar Younis bouncer.  <br/>  <br/> It is now a fable of courage for cricketers worldwide, that he declined medical assistance, took his guard, wiped the blood off, continued to bat. He went on to compile a fluent 57 that would effectively help India draw the Test match. Tendulkar, though not prolific with the bat as he was in the domestic level, had shown the toughness for hunger required for the international level by taking body blows and was retained in the Test side.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Conquest of Paradise</b> <br/> After the tour of Pakistan, Tendulkar toured New Zealand, and scored 88 in one of the Test matches, missing out on becoming the youngest Test centurion of all time by 12 runs. He eventually got to the mark when India toured England in 1990, as he ended up scoring 119* in the fourth innings at Manchester, digging India out of a hole and putting them in a good enough position to win the match if there was a session more to bat. After scoring a hundred in Manchester, he continued to score freely in the tour of Australia, starting off with a 148 at Sydney and becoming the youngest batsman to score a Test hundred in Australia, and a 114 on a bouncy WACA wicket, which is popularly regarded by himself and experts, as perhaps his best Test innings.  <br/>  <br/> After a series of fantastic performances in his first cluster of away tours, Tendulkar was hailed as a natural talent and a landmark for adaptability. He continued to perform particularly well overseas, as he toured South Africa in 1996/97, to score a fantastic 169 at Cape Town in a counterattack for the ages with Mohammad Azharuddin. It was a game that India went on to lose, but Tendulkar had picked India up from a terrible situation and exhibited the gulf in batting prowess between him and his peers to the extent that even Allan Donald, who had terrorized the top order of India, admitted that he felt like clapping for the little genius. He had already shown his batting ability in South Africa, having previously scored a 111 (in a team total of 227) in 1992 en route to the milestone of 1,000 Test runs in Johannesburg.  <br/>  <br/> After a plethora of incredible away performances, a solid home record away a given. He scored his first Test hundred at home in Chennai, lacing a fluent 165 against England to guide his team to a dominating innings victory. Little did he know several of his defining knocks would come at the very ground. In 1998, when the Tendulkar versus Warne contest was much anticipated in Australia’s home series against India, Tendulkar custom-built a training method to sweep Warne from the rough outside the leg-stump and unleashed this strategy in the Chennai Test by absolutely pummeling Warne on his way to a match-winning 155 in the second innings. India went on to win the Test series 2-1 against an all-conquering Australia.    <br/>  <br/> <b>Technique</b> <br/> <BLOCKQUOTE>“I was very very struck by his technique. I never saw myself play, but I feel, that this fella is playing much the same as I used to play. ”</BLOCKQUOTE> <br/> Sir Donald Bradman, the ultimate batsman, once said to his wife that he felt Tendulkar played the same way as he used to. It was perhaps the ultimate compliment that a batsman could hope to receive.  <br/>  <br/> When Tendulkar started playing Test cricket, the raw talent was evident, but his technique needed some polishing up. With negligible upper body strength as a 16-year-old, Tendulkar would lean on his bat in his stance, resulting in his head falling over into the off-side, particularly while playing the leg glance. Over the years, however, Tendulkar created a technique suited to be used in a batting simulator.  <br/>  <br/> Sachin Tendulkar dominated with the bat in an era that saw some of the fiercest seam bowlers of all time in their prime: McGrath, Fraser, Walsh, Ambrose and Pollock. In addition, swing-bowling greats like Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, spin legends such as Warne and Muralitharan, and express-pacers approaching supersonic speeds including Brett Lee, Allan Donald and Shoaib Akhtar, were at the peak of their powers during the Little Master’s reign. Tendulkar not only survived the ambush across the turn of the millenium, but played his best cricket during this period. How? It was all based on a strong foundation and a rock-solid technique.   <br/>  <br/> The key was playing late. With a stance and compactness built for a typical opener, his partial paranoia and skepticism of the ball until the moment it reached with minimal back-lift and a punchy (almost zero) follow-through to counter that, made his basic technique almost airtight. This allows him to pick up late movement off the pitch and play the ball as late as possible. Add to that the amount of leverage and power he was capable of generating despite using a relatively low grip was one of the several things about the man that dropped jaws.  <br/>  <br/> Sachin’s post-injury technique was exclusive of the pull and the hook shots, but it was more compact and powerful, never allowing the top part of the bottom hand to leave the torso while driving, and allowing him to play the ball under his eyes. The V-shaped bottom-hand grip, although low, allowed him to watch the ball right onto the bat, allowing him to the liberty to find gaps with surgical precision, and executing the shots at the pivotal moment with the grace of a trapeze artist.  <br/>  <br/> The back and across trigger movement and a still head are required to get a good idea of your off-stump and to leave or play accordingly. With his eye on off-stump at the point of delivery, he had a simple and productive method to leave balls outside the eye-line - and outside the line of the off-stump. Apart from the much-hyped stats, this air-tight, versatile technique formed the foundation of Sachin Tendulkar’s legend. <br/>  <br/> <b>The captaincy debacle </b> <br/> Tendulkar was made the captain of the side in 1996 at the age of 23, but with 7 years of experience behind him. A poor record, the egos of senior players to manage, and an avalanche of internal conflict, couldn’t quite dent Tendulkar’s performances with the bat, as he continued to score runs despite India being blanked by the opposition. In his second tenure as captain, which was thrust upon him without his contest, India lost a Test series to South Africa at home and Tendulkar’s own form was taking a hit, and he stepped down from captaincy. Sourav Ganguly took over as the leader in 2000, with the hopes of building a new Indian team amidst the match-fixing scandal that had taken the cricket world by storm.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Back to business</b> <br/> 1998 was Tendulkar’s year as a batsman; a year when he played some of the most celebrated knocks in his career, including two of his most famous ODI innings. He scored a majestic 143 in the league stages of the Coca Cola Cup to get India into the final at Sharjah, and then scored 134 in the final against Australia to single-handedly take India past the finishing line. In the same year, he nearly pulled off another single-handed effort at Chennai, nearly pulling off a 4th innings chase against Pakistan whilst battling back spasms, before departing with India 17 runs short of victory. India went on to lose the match, but Tendulkar was the the man of the match for his breathtaking performance.  <br/>  <br/> Tendulkar lost his father during the 1999 World Cup, and returned home from England. He came back and scored a 140 against Kenya, dedicating the hundred to his father and giving birth to his ritual of looking up to the heavens after a hundred. In 2001, he scored a hundred in the deciding Test of Australia final frontier series in India, leading them to a fairytale win as Indian cricket redeemed itself from the shoddy crevices of match-fixing. <br/>  <br/> Nevertheless, the next year saw Tendulkar go through an alarming dip in form, as he struggled in New Zealand and West Indies, before notching up a 193 in Leeds to go past Sir Don Bradman’s century tally of 29 hundreds. Tendulkar was back at his best in time for the World Cup of 2003, scoring 673 runs in a Man of the Tournament performance for his side. India ended up losing in the final, but Tendulkar set a record for World Cups that has been hitherto unmatched. Moreover, he played arguably the greatest World Cup innings of all time as he laced a 75-ball 98 against Pakistan in Centurion while chasing 274 against the pace battery of Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, and Shoaib Akhtar. <br/>  <br/> Tendulkar continued to score runs, with the odd daddy hundred here and there to satisfy his insatiable appetite. This included a 194* against Pakistan in Multan, a 241* in Sydney in 2004 and a 141 against Pakistan in the 5-match ODI series in 2004. However, India lost Tendulkar to a tennis elbow injury that kept him out for the best part of a year. He returned at the end of 2004 to play Australia in a dead-rubber at the Wankhede, and led India to a consolation win with a commanding 55 on a minefield of a pitch.  <br/>  <br/> <b>'Endulkar' and its debunking</b> <br/> After ongoing an operation on his shoulder, he returned for the DLF cup in Malaysia in 2006. He scored a hundred upon his return, his 40th ODI hundred, and redeemed his career - allowing his bat to do the talking in the face of the “Endulkar” shenanigans.  <br/>  <br/> After a torrid period in Indian cricket, with the Greg Chappell saga unfolding, India were left ruing a World Cup ouster in the first round in 2007. However, after the sacking of Chappell and the recommendation of MS Dhoni as captain by Tendulkar, Indian cricket found its feet again and Tendulkar started to score runs and achieve milestones every time he picked up the bat.  <br/>  <br/> Sachin Tendulkar went on to break several records over the next few years: he became the highest run-scorer in Test cricket, going past Brian Lara's record of 11,953 runs in Mohali against Australia. In December 2008, he pulled off an unlikely chase on a dry turner in Chennai, knocking down the 387 set by England and scoring the winning runs to get to 103*, and providing the Indian public with some much-needed solace in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai on the 26th of November 2008.  <br/>  <br/> After a historic Test series win in England (2007), Tendulkar contributed handsomely in the controversy-marred tour of Australia, which India lost 1-2, but it was a series which could have been won by India if not for the appalling umpiring, proving to be pivotal in the context of the series. In the CB series that followed, Tendulkar answered all the naysayers with the willow, by scoring a 117* in the 1st final at Melbourne and a 91 in the second final at Brisbane to lead India to their first ODI tournament win in Australian soil. Tendulkar had regained his form of old and continued to score freely in all conditions, scoring his 50th and 51st Test hundreds in South Africa in 2010 - another series that India tied 1-1 but certainly threatened to win in Cape Town where a blistering battle of Tendulkar vs. Steyn was witnessed in all its hostility. He was named the ICC Player of the year and ODI player of the year in 2010. <br/>  <br/> On 24th February 2010, Tendulkar was the first to reach the ODI summit of scoring a double-hundred, scoring 200* against South Africa in Gwalior, having come close to the mark twice before within a year of the landmark (163 retired hurt against New Zealand and 175 against Australia). The milestone has been eclipsed several times since... <br/>  <br/> Coming into the 2011 World Cup with a rich vein of form, Tendulkar contributed handsomely to a victorious campaign with 482 runs, the second-most in the tournament, and lifted the World Cup trophy in his homeground. He was paraded around the Wankhede, draped with a tricolour over his shoulders - one of the lasting images of the World Cup and perhaps in the history of World Cup cricket.  <br/>  <br/> <b>The World Cup Hangover</b> <br/> After a dream run in the World Cup of 2011, the hangover followed. Tendulkar, still stranded on 99 international hundreds, seemed to have a long wait ahead as he missed the mark on two nightmarish Test tours of England and Australia, where he got close to the mark but failed to get across the line. After a year-long wait, he finally reached the landmark in an Asia Cup league game against Bangladesh at Mirpur, scoring his 100th international hundred to help India to 290 only for India’s bowling to fail at a crucial time and concede the match. His 51 against Pakistan in the same tournament ended up being his final ODI game as he announced his retirement from ODI cricket on 23rd December 2012, finishing his career as, by far, the highest run-scorer and century-maker in the format.  <br/>  <br/> <b>A nation in tears</b> <br/> On November 16, 2013, 24 years and a day after his Test debut, Tendulkar bid a tearful adieu to Test cricket at the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai. His 200th Test match, against the West Indies, culminated in a win for India, as Sachin contributed handsomely with a fluent 74. The Wankhede was stunned into silence when he was caught at slip and had to walk back to the pavilion. However, his rousing speech after the match, wherein he mentioned that the chants of “Sachin Sachin will reverberate in my ears until my last breath”, reinvigorated the crowd into a new spree of the chant - perhaps for the last time ever. <br/>  <br/> A select few living souls may have even watched the Don bat. The rising pulse, the bursting eardrums, and the blinding tears as one involuntarily starts to chant along with the crowd is this generation's collective cocaine. The whole nation is high, when that show-stopping icon wields the willow and enchants a billion - <i>Sachin Tendulkar...</i>.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Rishi Roy</b> <br/> <i>As of October 2019</i>",

      "bio": "There are very few better sights in world cricket than witnessing a free-flowing Yuvraj Singh at his best. Undoubtedly, he is right up there among the greatest match-winners in white-ball cricket. Those glorious cover drives, slap cuts through backward point and an effortless wristy drop kick over mid-wicket, all oozed class. His full repertoire was on display during his international debut that came in the 50-overs format against Australia in the 2000 Champions Trophy. It wasn't everyday that a batsman put the formidable Aussie attack to sword during that time and certainly not a rookie. Yuvraj had arrived with a bang and what instantly stood out apart from his batting, was the electric fielding skills. India's fielding was on an average level in that era and hence someone like Yuvraj came as a whiff of fresh air. <br/>  <br/> Despite gaining immediate stardom, Yuvraj wasn't able to capitalize on it with fitness and commitment issues dogging him. But, as he was to show multiple times in the years to come, the lad from Punjab roared back in style, in the 2002 season where he produced quite a few impact knocks, none bigger than the iconic Natwest final heist with Mohammad Kaif. Since that tournament, Yuvraj gradually cemented his spot as a middle order batsman who could build an innings as well as explode at will. His utility left-arm spin also made him a complete limited-overs package and his performances were instrumental in India's steady rise in the shorter formats. They finished runners-up in the 2003 World Cup and despite scoring a lot of runs, Yuvraj still produced some crucial knocks. <br/>  <br/> Over the next few years, Yuvraj along with the then raw MS Dhoni became vital cogs of the Indian middle order that relished chasing down scores in ODI cricket. The duo often made a mockery of the opposition's target and India at one point even held a record for the most successful run chases in a trot. Yuvraj was gaining at the peak of his powers and one impeccable quality of his was to rise in big tournaments/matches. There were many instances when he was not in great touch but would go on to fire instantly in an ICC tournament. The man simply loved to rock on the big stage and deal with the pressures that came with it.  <br/>  <br/> Such was Yuvraj's ability with the bat that he was well ahead of the T20 format that had just started to spread its wings in 2007. The inaugural World T20 happened and his strokeplay in that showpiece even is till date regarded as one of the best in cricket's history. Not only did he become the first Indian to smash 6 sixes in an over but also produced a free-wheeling assault in the semifinal against Australia as India surged into the finals and eventually became the champions. Yuvraj particularly enjoyed playing against Australia and as many of his ODI knocks had shown before, he often rose to the occasion. <br/>  <br/> At times, there were doubts over Yuvraj's ability to play genuine pace and the short ball while some felt that he struggled to start an innings against spinners. All these were just relative terms though for the southpaw because when he was in the mood, there were few who could stop him. Such was his impact on the team that India mostly won the game when he clicked. The IPL caravan came in 2008 and he was the captain of the Punjab franchise in the first few seasons before switching teams. Surprisingly, Yuvraj never really had a runaway IPL season despite all his heroics for India. Of course, he did produce a few knocks here and there but there was never a strong season for him as such. <br/>  <br/> The 2010-11 season saw a really lean patch for Yuvraj as he was struggling big time to score runs. With the ODI World Cup around the corner, there were concerns on whether he would be in the squad or not. But the then skipper MS Dhoni was adamant and confident of Yuvraj's skills and the dasher repaid his captain's faith in the best possible way - Man of the Tournament award on cricket's biggest stage as India reclaimed the World Cup after 28 years. Yuvraj's impact was hard to miss as he contributed with the bat at vital times apart from also filling in as the fifth bowler with astonishing success. All this apart from his fielding which had started to fade a bit but still in rather good shape. <br/>  <br/> Post the 2011 World Cup, the tragic news came that Yuvraj had been battling the initial stages of cancer even before the tournament. He barely played any matches in that season and went for rehabs over an extensive period of time. Like his batting, Yuvraj was a fighter in real life too and fought his way back from cancer. However, that fight came at a cost as he wasn't the player he was before the disease hit him. He was a pale shadow of his past during the 2013-14 season and biggest tragedy was seeing him struggle in the World T20 final of 2014. He was producing the odd good knock during this phase but the fluency of yesteryear was definitely missing. After that World T20 final, he was axed from India's limited-overs teams and he himself revealed that the body wasn't perhaps fully fit. <br/>  <br/> Over the next few seasons, Yuvraj worked hard on his fitness and although he missed the 2015 World Cup and 2016 World T20, he made a comeback in early 2017 after a strong domestic showing. With the no.4 slot starting to haunt India in a big way, Virat Kohli felt that the veteran would fit the bill, especially with the Champions Trophy due that year. Yuvraj did churn out a few impact knocks after his comeback and even blitzed Pakistan in the Champions Trophy opener. The shots hadn't diminished at all, but what had gone was that consistency and fluency which were now coming occasionally. <br/>  <br/> After the 2017 Champions Trophy where India finished runners-up, Yuvraj was among a few senior players who were axed from the side. The shocking decline for him was in his fielding which was unthinkable a decade ago. Although the initial reasoning given was 'resting', it was evident that the think tank were looking beyond them with the 2019 World Cup in mind. Yuvraj continues to play domestic cricket and harbors hopes of another international comeback which though, seems unlikely.  <br/>  <br/> Despite all his success in white-ball cricket, Yuvraj was never able to make an impression in Tests. The case is quite similar to Australian great Michael Bevan who endured a fine career in ODIs but struggled in the longest format. Yuvraj also wasn't able to get a grip of red-ball cricket although he did produce a few fine knocks. In domestic cricket, he had played several marathon knocks but wasn't able to replicate that form or consistency at the highest level. Irrespective of what the future holds for him, Yuvraj shall be remembered as one of India's finest limited-overs greats. <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> In the first round of the 2019 IPL auctions, there were no takers for Yuvraj Singh. It was just another illustration of how this competition doesn't care for reputations. The celebrated left-handed all-rounder was coming off a poor 2018 season with the Kings XI Punjab where he looked a pale shadow of his old self, with just 65 runs from 6 innings. <br/>  <br/> It was the franchise where he had started off as an icon player in 2008, when he was going through the prime of his career. Under his leadership that year, Kings XI Punjab went the furthest that they've ever gone in IPL till date - to the play-offs. Yuvraj's batting himself was impactful, if not very consistent. Although he scored just one half-century that season, his strike-rate was an impressive 162.5. <br/>  <br/> But a disappointing season in 2009, both personally and for the franchise, meant that Yuvraj was relieved from captaincy in favour of Kumar Sangakkara, which didn't do much to turn the fortunes of the franchise, but definitely affected Yuvraj's confidence which showed in the performances. It would result in the first of his many franchise switches. <br/>  <br/> In 2011, barely a week after playing an instrumental role in India winning the World Cup, Yuvraj turned up to lead Pune Warriors who had bought him for USD 1.8 million. And he had his best IPL season yet, finishing as the franchise's top run-getter with 343 runs, but it wasn't enough to keep the team from ending up second-last in the points table. <br/>  <br/> Yuvraj missed the 2012 season altogether due to his fight with cancer, but returned in 2013, albeit he was nowhere near his best and couldn't do much to lift a sinking Pune campaign. His form notwithstanding, Yuvraj was the most expensive player in the 2014 auction where Royal Challengers Bangalore shelled out INR 14 crores for his services, and then again at the 2015 auction where Delhi Daredevils bought him for INR 16 crores. But the lack of big-money performances couldn't keep him at those franchises for more than a year. <br/>  <br/> In 2016, Yuvraj was picked up by Sunrisers Hyderabad for INR 7 crores, where he had another couple of middling seasons. He wasn't bad, but it wasn't the Yuvraj people had grown used to, and so another franchise change beckoned, and it would be none other than KXIP who came calling in 2018, offering him the base price value of INR 2 crores. But a return to his original home wasn't enough to bring him back to his old self either. And hence, the first-round snub in the 2019 auctions wasn't completely surprising. <br/>  <br/> But before the door could possibly be closed on his IPL future, Mumbai Indians reached out at the base price of INR 1 crore. It's the sixth IPL franchise that Yuvraj is set to play for, and it's basically his second home as he's been living in Mumbai for the past 10 years. \"Brings back 2011 memories. That's the first thing that comes to my mind. Good memories. Probably the best memories,\" Yuvraj said in the lead-up to IPL 2019. <br/>  <br/> Yuvraj Singh announced his decision to retire from all forms of international cricket on June 10, 2019. <br/>  <br/> <b>By Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "<b>In a Nutshell</b> <br/> In a nation that has an affinity towards premature regret, <i>playing it safe</i> is an inherent attribute instilled in their decision-making. India tends to opt for the orthodox investment choice that offers returns and contentment in the short term over the maverick idea that could potentially change the game. This sensible, if potentially short-sighted approach has produced many a talent in Indian cricket. Nevertheless, India is also a nation that loves a good story, and consequently, every so often, it regurgitates a few outliers. A polio-stricken turbo-legspinner, a precocious 16-year-old man-child, and more recently, a gloveman with the most astute, un-Indian audacity. Similarly, around the turn of the millennium, a short-statured batsman from the wilds of Najafgarh had emerged as an explosive batsman and was slated to play a newly introduced slog-fest in Hong Kong as the Indian team got ready for its dreaded tour to South Africa. <br/>  <br/> <b>Induction into Test Cricket</b> <br/> As fate would have it, after some selection shenanigans, the backing of some ex-cricketers like Madan Lal and Jaywant Lele, and Sourav Ganguly's non-selection due to slow over-rate against South Africa, the universe managed to tweak destiny for yet another nonconformist to make his entry into Indian cricket: Virender Sehwag found himself in the Indian dressing room of the Bloemfontein cricket ground in Free State, South Africa, being presented Test cap #239 for India, and awaiting his turn to wield the willow.  <br/>  <br/> As Virender Sehwag, then fond of short-sleeved shirts, joined his idol Sachin Tendulkar on the center strip at the Mangaung Oval, the standard definition generation suddenly found it difficult to spot the difference between the strokeplay of the two. The uncanny resemblance between their compact and punchy strokeplay (which was no coincidence, as Sehwag later admitted), was of no help to those trying to tell them apart, and nor was their similar stature. The man who bats like Tendulkar: this caused a wave of excitement in the Indian masses, as Sehwag started to take apart the famed South African bowling along with the master at the other end. There were check-drives, cover drives, flicks, and even the signature late-cuts and an early rendition of the upper-cut which would later go on to become a defining shot. According to experts, Sehwag has an inexplicable ability to render any technical analysis useless, and in turn, to make the situation, the bowler and the pitch seem irrelevant. With his nonchalant approach at the crease, it is ironic that all the attention is centered around him when he is at the crease.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Style of Play</b> <br/> Given the prerequisite of his talent, hand-eye coordination et al, Sehwag's approach to batting is based on a simple philosophy and a disability: the philosophy is that of sighting the ball and hitting the ball, and allow the rest of his body to follow his hands: transfer-of-weight batting over reach-the-pitch batting, a theoretically plausible form of batting which was deemed impractical against express-pace and quality bowling, until Virender Sehwag entered the game. The disability was his non-possession of the last-ball syndrome: Regardless of the events of the previous ball, he was capable of focusing on the next delivery unperturbed by the match situation or anxiety. Yet, he had the anticipation that defines every great batsman.  <br/>  <br/> Due to his style of play, Sehwag was initially typecast as a limited-overs specialist, and had to wait two years after making his ODI debut to play a Test match, but in an ironic twist of fate, it is his Test record that is far more imposing, while he has not done justice to his enormous talent in One Day Internationals. After some middling performances when he came into the scene initially, Sehwag exploded when sent in to open the innings against New Zealand in his 15th ODI, scoring a century off 69 balls and announcing himself to the world.  <br/>  <br/> His strike-rate in ODIs is second only to Shahid Afridi amongst the batsmen who have scored at least 1000 runs, but his average of just 34 runs is far below his Test match average of 49.34. In ODIs, Sehwag has always threatened to take the match away from the opposition, but not done it often enough, residing to being the top-order cameo player and hammering the leather off the ball to make life easier for the middle-order. Even so, he held the record for the fastest ODI hundred by an Indian (off 60 balls) for 4 years before Virat Kohli stormed past it in the sixathon series against Australia in 2013. Furthermore, in December 2011, Sehwag scored a remarkable 219 in an ODI against the West Indies at Indore, which was only the 2nd ODI double-hundred at the time, and the highest ever score in ODIs until Rohit Sharma blazed past it during his epic 264 in late 2014.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Revolutionizing the 'Test Opener'</b> <br/> His Test record, however, set him apart and truly stumped the great minds of the game. After being type-cast as a limited-overs player due to his aggressive and unorthodox approach at the crease, the astute mind of Sourav Ganguly perhaps saw something that no one else did and Sehwag was thrust into the opening role along with Sanjay Bangar on the tour to England in 2002. On a seaming green-top in Nottingham with the home-owners breathing down his neck, Sehwag used his simple, compact technique to give himself enough time for the ball to come on to him, and nullified all new-ball woes with a fantastic 105 in the first innings and made the spot his own.  <br/>  <br/> Sehwag continued to redefine the opener's role at the Test level, with a golden run of form after he was thrust into the top-order. After a hundred against the West Indies at home, Sehwag made the Boxing Day Test of 2003 his own with an attacking hundred at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and fell just five short of his first double hundred in Tests whilst trying to clear the mid-wicket boundary to get there. Nevertheless, such was the audacity of the man, that only a few months later, when on 297* against Pakistan in Multan, Sehwag hoisted Saqlain Mushtaq for six to bring an end to a 72-year-old wait and became India's first ever triple-centurion in Test cricket.  <br/>  <br/> A penchant for <i>'daddy'</i> hundreds was a defining part of his Test career, with 13 out of 23 Test centuries in excess of 150. Sehwag went onto make another triple hundred, as the visiting Proteas facing his wrath in the sapping heat of Chennai in March 2008: a phenomenal feat against an attack consisting of Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Jacques Kallis and Makhaya Ntini at the peak of their fitness; not to mention the fact that this was the fastest triple-hundred in the history of Test cricket as he joined an elite list of players who have scored 2 Test triple-hundreds: only behind Sir Donald George Bradman and Brian Charles Lara. <br/>  <br/> In 2006, during India's tour of Pakistan, Sehwag combined with Rahul Dravid to score a phenomenal and chanceless 254 on the way to a 410-run partnership, just falling short of the record for the highest first wicket stand set by Vinoo Mankad and Pankaj Roy almost 50 years ago. The Times of India frontpage on the following day listed the records that Sehwag could break the following day, which included that of Brian Lara's 400* - such was the flow Sehwag was in at Lahore. Sehwag's form faded away over the course of the year, and he was subsequently dropped from the Test side in late 2007. He missed the tour of England and most of the tour Down under as well. However, in the wake of the Monkeygate incident, Sehwag was recalled for the final Test at Adelaide where he stormed back into form with an uncharacteristically patient 151 from 236 balls to draw a Test which India were in danger of losing. He retained his spot in the side and thus started the Gambhir-Sehwag opening partnership that ruled Indian cricket for a few years since.  <br/>  <br/> In December 2009, during Brabourne's first Test match in 36 years, Sehwag welcomed the historic ground back in style by lacing 284* in two and a half sessions on Day 2. On a dry and spinning track. he toyed around with an attack consisting of Rangana Herath and Muttiah Muralitharan, hammering 202 runs off boundaries alone (40 fours, 7 sixes). He could only add 9 to his overnight total and fell short of a historic third triple-hundred by 7 runs. Sehwa1g walked back, mildly annoyed, as India won the Test by an innings and consequently received the Test championship mace. A nation rued the near miss by Sehwag, but the man himself remained typically carefree as suggested by his words at the end of the day's play: 'Not many people have got two triple centuries and followed that with 293.' <br/>  <br/> Sehwag had a golden year in 2010, as he took apart bowling attacks in a year with a phethora of home series. He started off with South Africa, taking their attack apart in a scintillating 165 in Kolkata as India went on to win a thrilling Test in the last session to draw the series. A string of excellent performances saw him win the most prestigious award in Test cricket: the ICC Test Player of the Year as he went into the World Cup of 2011 in sublime form and formed a formidable partnership with Sachin Tendulkar, laying into bowling attacks and hammering the new ball out of shape. His famous streak of first-ball fours in the World Cup to put India firmly in control from ball 1 started on the first ball of tournament as he flayed Shafiul Islam for four against Bangladesh to start with, on his way to an explosive 175. He played other innings of note too, including a 73 against South Africa to set the tone for a tornado even Steyn and co. didn't see coming and a momentum-changing 38 in the semi-final, in which he hammered Pakistan's best bowler, Umar Gul, for four fours in an over and handed India the momentum in a relatively low-scoring game which they went on to win. <br/>  <br/> <b>Tryst with Injuries</b> <br/> A persistent shoulder injury meant that Sehwag slowly started to lose his form overseas, and his shoulder-dominant reach-out-and-hit shots were no longer good enough in pacier and bouncier tracks like South Africa, and in seaming conditions like England. He continued to be a major force in the subcontinent, though, and played a handsome role in India's 2011 World Cup triumph. He set the platform for the campaign with a blistering 175 against Bangladesh in Dhaka and played important, tone-setting knocks throughout the tournament by throwing opening bowlers off their game by hitting them for fours off the first ball of the innings. His opening stand of 145 with Tendulkar against South Africa was vital, as he scored a quick 73, only for the middle order to capsize at the death. One of his more underrated innings was the 25-ball 38 on an initially seaming and subsequently turning track in the semifinal against Pakistan, where he hammered Pakistan's spearhead Umar Gul for five boundaries in his second over and broke his confidence.  <br/>  <br/> In the hangover of the 2011 World Cup triumph, his injury aggravated and there were questions asked of his fitness and his performance. In his last 20 appearances he managed just one score of hundred of more, a stat that reflected India's poor run in Test cricket during the period. His shoulder injury and deteriorating eyesight were starting to affect his game, particularly in the bouncier and faster away conditions. Nevertheless, Sehwag was called back, mid-injury, for the Manchester Test in 2011 as an emergency measure only to be dismissed for a king pair as India went on to be whitewashed 0-4 in England. In the subsequent 0-4 whitewash in Australia later that year, he was one of the better batsmen as he scored two fifties (in Melbourne and Adelaide) and managed to cling onto his place in the side. The ageing titans of Indian cricket came into serious question after they were beaten 1-2 in their own backyard by England in late 2012, but Sehwag got a final chance and was retained in the side for the home Test series against Australia, based on his hundred in Ahmedabad against England. Alas, a string of poor scores meant he was forced out of the side for the last two Tests - and we never saw him in the off-whites again.  <br/>  <br/> <b>The Twilight</b> <br/> He went back to the domestic circuit in a quest to regain his spot in the national side but couldn't quite manage the wizardry of old. Sehwag played for Delhi Daredevils since the inception of the IPL till the 6th edition, but the franchise decided not to retain him for the 7th. After his Test retirement, he went into the auctions pool and was signed by Kings XI Punjab and performed admirably for them with a 58-ball 122 in the eliminator of the 2014 IPL which drove the franchise into its inaugural final. The following IPL, a disappointing tournament for Sehwag, was his final season as he took over the management of the Punjab franchise.  <br/>  <br/> He called it quits from all competitive cricket on the 20th of October 2015, his 37th birthday, drawing a curtain on a decorated career that saw several highs and lows. World Cups, king pairs, triple-hundreds and whitewashes. Qualitatively speaking, despite being able to play out challenging phases of play against the new ball, he was ousted from the Test team due to lack of big scores in the twilight of his career. It's certainly a question of a closer inspection and qualitative analysis in a country obsessed with statistics and has no place for assisting batsmen. When asked to comment on his ouster and never donning the India colours again and his tryst with the one-dimensional selection committee, Sehwag signed off with typically blithe disregard and a carefree rhetorical question: <i>'And whose loss is that?'</i> <br/>  <br/> By <b>Rishi Roy</b> <br/> <i>As of 14th July 2018</i>",

      "bio": "Gautam Gambhir's cricketing career has all the trappings of a typical Bollywood flick- the glamour, the drama, the passion, the chutzpah, the wrangles, and of course the proverbial acche din and bure din.  <br/>  <br/> Gambhir's journey as a first-class cricketer began in the 1999-2000 season. But, it was a couple of years later, in 2002, that the Delhi lad first stole the spotlight. Then playing for the Board President's XI against a touring Zimbabwe team, the left-hander smashed a double century scoring 218 runs. A year later, came the big moment: Gambhir secured his place in the Indian team for the TVS Cup, a triangular fixture.  <br/>  <br/>  Not as gifted as some of his contemporaries, initially Gambhir had to grin and bear it when selectors would just choose to overlook him. However, what separated him from the pack was his passion for the game and an almost insatiable appetite for runs.  <br/>  <br/> At the topmost level, the stakes are high. Bowlers keep an eye out for even the minutest of shortcomings in the best of batsmen. And Gambhir had a chink in his otherwise formidable armour: His front foot would fall over a bit, which often made him an easy LBW prey to quality fast bowlers. This flaw in the technique proved to be the recurrent glitch that kept his bat quiet between 2003 and 2006. Having fixed the fault, Gambhir was again in the reckoning, scoring enough to stake a claim for a place in India's 2007 ODI World Cup squad. But, the selectors thought otherwise. They preferred to instead go with hard-hitting right-hander Robin Uthappa, who had, under his belt, some match-winning knocks at the top of the order. <br/>  <br/> The rejection severely jolted Gambhir, who even contemplated quitting the game. But, destiny had other plans in store for him. The same year in September, Gambhir was called back to open the batting with his Delhi mate Virender Sehwag for the T-20 World Cup. He grabbed the opportunity with both hands.  <br/>  <br/> In the high-voltage final against Pakistan, Gambhir showed nerves of steel scoring 75 runs that made all the difference. He was the second highest scorer in the tournament with 227 runs in the 7 innings. After that feat, Gambhir always enjoyed the backing of skipper MS Dhoni, but failed to break into the team. It was sheer hard luck, as legends of the game like Tendulkar still graced the Indian top-order. <br/>  <br/> Gambhir was on the top of his game between 2008 and 2011. Always looking aggressive on the field, he hit the purple patch in those years scoring big and often match-winning knocks. In the 2008 CB series Down Under, Gambhir blazed a trail when he outscored the likes of Sachin, Ponting and Sangakara to emerge as the highest run-scorer of that ODI tri-series. Soon, Gambhir cemented his place in the ODI team, filling the big shoes of iconic left-hander Sourav Ganguly. The spectacular showing in the ODIs, earned him a place in the Test team, too.  <br/>  <br/>  Having scored his first Test century against Bangladesh at Chittagong in 2004 , it took Gambhir almost four years to score his second test ton. But the third one came only nine days after. Of his 9 test centuries, the one he scored at Napier in New Zealand in 2009 will be remembered for long. Batting for a staggering 643 minutes, Gambhir showed grit deploying his stoic defence and scoring a match-saving 137 runs.  <br/>  <br/>  By 2009, Gambhir had established himself as one of the top batsmen in International cricket. The same year, he received the prestigious ICC Test Cricketer of The Year award. Two years later, his decisive knock in the final of the 2011 ODI World Cup, which India won, made him a national hero of sorts. <br/>  <br/> Post -2011 World Cup, many even saw Gambhir as next-in-line to MS Dhoni. But then came the slide in his fortunes. One bad series was followed by another, runs dried up and questions begun to be asked of his technique. In the 17 Test matches between 2011 and 2012, he averaged just 31. Eventually, he faced the axe. <br/>  <br/> Between 2007 and 2011, Gambhir had done enough with the bat to stamp his name in bold letters in the history of Indian cricket as one of the best left-handed batsmen to have played for India across all formats.  <br/>  <br/>  In 2014 and 2016, Gambhir made two short comebacks to the test team, but could never simply get his act together. During this phase, even though Gambhir was struggling in the International arena, he was among the most valued players in the IPL.  <br/>  <br/> KKR paid a handsome sum of Rs 11 crore in the IPL auction in 2011. Taking up the cudgels, Gambhir revamped the fortune of a struggling team, leading them to famous IPL title wins in 2012 and 2014.  <br/>  <br/> Now, in the 2018, Gambhir will again be seen in action with Delhi Daredevils.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Varun Dixit</b> <br/> As of 6th April 2018 <br/> ",

      "bio": "Arguably among India's finest T20 batsmen, Suresh Raina stormed into the international scene as a teenage prodigy during the Greg Chappell regime. Typical left-hander's elegance, power game and a fine temperament were the hallmark of Raina the batsman and he exhibited it beautifully during his ODI debut in 2005. After a stupendous start though, his form dipped over the next year and that was followed by a serious injury which meant that the career had hit a roadblock towards the latter part of 2007. The talent was obvious but Raina needed to translate that on the field as well. That's when the IPL Caravan debuted in 2008. <br/>  <br/> Raina was picked by the Chennai franchise for a fairly decent price and he put on a stellar show during the first season of the IPL - the result of which was a comeback to the national side soon after. Thereafter, Raina cemented his spot as a capable finisher for the side, often chipping in with priceless cameos apart from getting the sizable knocks whenever the opportunities came by. With India having a heavy top and middle order, Raina's role mostly was to provide the final flourish to the innings. The numbers don't exactly reveal how valuable he was during the 2008-2011 phase which was easily among the finest stages of Team India's ODI history, capped with World Cup glory as well. <br/>  <br/> A big example of Raina's big match temperament was the way he chipped in during the 2011 quarterfinal against Australia and then the semifinal against Pakistan. Both were cameos statistically but were worth its weight in gold. There were several such instances of him taking India across the line in pressure situations. The lofted inside out drive and an agricultural hoick over mid-wicket are the trademark Suresh Raina shots which he doles out with elan when in prime form. While he relished white-ball cricket, he couldn't replicate it in the longest version of the game. Although his Test career started with a fine century against Sri Lanka, his form fizzed away thereafter due to his imminent struggles against pace and swing. <br/>  <br/> Raina was the first Indian player to hold a century in all three formats of the game and although red-ball cricket wasn't his cup of tea, his contributions in the other formats were valuable to Indian cricket. There has always been immense criticism about his short ball phobia although in limited-overs cricket, that cannot really be a derailing flaw for a batsman with the modern day rules and regulations. His ODI century in England during the 2014 tour promised a revival regarding that aspect of his game but after the 2015 World Cup, he endured a couple of poor series which led to his axing from the side. <br/>  <br/> Time away from the Indian team wasn't good for Raina as he wasn't quite able to make the runs in domestic cricket. He still played T20Is although he found himself strangely dropped from there as well, ironically after a Man of the Match performance against England in early 2017. The criteria probably was the lack of First-class games in the 2016-17 season where personal issues affected his career a touch while fitness (read physique) dipped as well. To add to his misery, several contenders like Kedar Jadhav, Manish Pandey, Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul had all thrown their hats in the ring. Raina had the odds against him although his age and utility skills meant that he was never really out of the reckoning in the shorter formats. <br/>  <br/> After a really lean patch, Raina shone in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, India's domestic T20 tournament, in early 2018 and earned himself a recall to the Indian side for the T20 series in South Africa. He did decently well in South Africa, which pressed the selectors persisted with him for the Nidahas Trophy and the England tour. However, he was not picked for the national side after that due to not-so-great fitness levels and others grabbing opportunities. This meant he was out of the reckoning for the 2019 World Cup as well.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b>: <br/>  <br/> Raina was the backbone of Chennai Super Kings' success. His dashing left-hand style of play at No. 3 gave CSK the luxury to attack at will with a lot of firepower left down the order. The fact that he is currently the highest run-getter in the history of IPL (4985 runs before start of IPL 12) explains the magnanimity of Raina's contribution to the side and he is aptly nicknamed \"Chinna Thala\" by the CSK fans. The lofted straight drive (or hitting in the V) is a shot fans savour to watch as he audaciously plays without fear in a tournament like IPL. He recorded his highest-score in IPL - 100 not out against Kings XI Punjab in 2013 in Chennai, but his blitzkrieg (87 runs off just 25 balls) against KXIP in Qualifier 2 in 2015 standouts amongst all of his IPL performances. <br/>  <br/> Raina also bowls very useful right-arm off spin and was often used by Dhoni when he had to look for breakthroughs or try something different. However, he has not been bowling of late with many other options being available for the captain. When CSK faced a two-year exile after the 2015 season, Raina captained the temporary franchise Gujarat Lions as well. When CSK returned from the hiatus, he was one of the three players retained by the franchise . He has been one of the greats in IPL history, referred fondly as 'Mr.IPL' due to his dominance in the tournament, where he has scored in excess of 400 runs every year, barring two seasons. <br/>  <br/> <b>By Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "<b>In a nutshell</b> <br/> Zaheer Khan was, without a doubt, one of the greatest assets of Indian cricket. A country starved of fast-bowling talent, could not have stumbled upon a greater gift at the turn of the century when Javagal Srinath, India's spearhead at the time, was into his thirties and in the twilight of his career. Zaheer ended up as one of the greatest new-ball bowlers of all time (particularly to left-handers), an expert at the art of reverse-swing (even with the old white ball), a potent bowler in the Test arena, and finally, a World Cup hero. <br/>  <br/> Nevertheless, shielded behind this facade of glory, was a story of struggle.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Humble Beginnings</b> <br/> Zaheer first pursued his cricketing dream after moving to Mumbai, staying back in a small hospital room his father's aunt worked in, using it as a \"place to crash\" after practice. Training with veteran coach Sudhir Naik, Zaheer's raw talent was in his pace, as he trained in the National Cricket Camp nets during practice hours and played tennis ball cricket in his leisure time afterward. Naik helped Zaheer find a job at the textile mill to support his practice, with an INR 5000 (˜US$100) paycheck. According to Naik, he often didn't get to eat breakfast before practice, which, oddly enough, didn't seem to affect his pace much.  <br/>  <br/> Zaheer continued to work on his bowling, supporting his passion with a meager salary and buying his first cricket kit on his own. Even his bowling boots had to be arranged from the National Cricket Club's funds, as he continued to impress with his work ethic and commitment. Under Coach Naik, his skill was given direction and polished over the course of the next 3 years, and Zaheer made his entry into the Ranji fold. Taking giant strides in the domestic circuit, he impressed the selectors enough to be in the national reckoning within the next year: A huge achievement, given that Zaheer's coach had to convince his father not to thrust him into the engineering field - four years since, instead of a degree certificate and a grade transcript, a blue jersey with the India crest arrived at his doorstep. <br/>  <br/> <b>With the Men in Blue</b> <br/> Zaheer Khan made his debut in the ICC Knockout Cup in 2000 and immediately hit the headlines when he yorked Steve Waugh, beating him for pace. An Indian express-pacer was a once-in-a-blue-moon discovery, and his ability to bowl fast yorkers at the death, move the ball off the deck and in the air, and his ability to maintain his pace, set him apart from the more metronomic fast bowlers that India was used to. In short, Zaheer was an exciting maverick, who brought hope to the Indian pace arsenal which was ageing around the turn of the century. <br/>  <br/> In partnership with Ashish Nehra and Javagal Srinath, Zaheer formed India's first potent express-pace attack for India in the 2003 World Cup, in which India had a dream-run into the finals. On the back of some good form on the tour of New Zealand, and during the league stages of the World Cup, Zaheer gelled well with the other two during the course of the tournament. However, nerves got the better of the young pacer in the final as he engaged in an ill-advised verbal duel with Matthew Hayden and ended up leaking 67 runs in 7 overs. This started a downward spiral for Zaheer as injuries and poor form forced him out of the team for a considerable period. There were concerns about his fitness and fragility on numerous occasions, given his uncanny knack of breaking down in the middle of a series, but he finally made it back to the team in 2004. He lacked the pace and accuracy of old, however, and conceded his spot to a host of new youngsters in the circuit including RP Singh, Irfan Pathan, Munaf Patel, and Sreesanth. Zaheer was in dire need of a redemption at the crossroads of a promising career.  <br/>  <br/> Zaheer decided to take the county-path and regain his fitness. After signing with Worcestershire, he immedaitely regained his form of old and did extremely well with the Dukes, which seemed to work well with his style of bowling with its proud seam and shine retention. He picked up 10 wickets on debut for the county, becoming the first player in over a hundred years to achieve the feat. A fitter, more versatile Zaheer Khan emerged out of the cold English weather, and he was rewarded with a shot at redemption: a recall into Team India in 2006. <br/>  <br/> <b>His second coming</b> <br/> Upon his comeback, Zaheer had cut down on pace, but his accuracy was unbelievable, particularly to left-handers. He had made it a habit of dismissing left-handed openers, particularly Graeme Smith, who continued to struggle against him until the end of his career. Zaheer's career-defining spell in Test cricket came at Nottingham in the wake of the infamous 'jelly beans' incident, as he turned the mathc on its head to deliver a famous Test series victory in England. Zaheer's mastery of reverse swing, along with Ishant Sharma's seam movement, caused the Australians a lot of trouble when they toured India in late 2008. He slowly matured into the leader of the young pace attack and assumed the role of a mentor to the younger pacers in the side such as Ishant Sharma, RP Singh and Sreesanth, often seen mentoring them in terms of field settings, bowling tactics, and the like.  <br/>  <br/> His experience was most used in the 2011 World Cup when he was the joint leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 21 wickets and more importantly provided crucial breakthroughs for India with the new ball, and more importantly, managed to invariably come back in the batting powerplay to pick up wickets with his reverse-swing and the newly-developed and well-disguised knuckle-ball. The World Cup turned out to be his last successful series for India. In the seasons that followed, Zaheer Khan succumbed to injuries and eventually lost his place in the side, starting off the first session of the first Test against England at Lord's - an injury which forced him out of the Test and cost India the match, and eventually the series. He made a comeback on the tour of Australia later that year but couldn't perform to the best of his potential. After a string of below-par performances, he was finally dropped from the Test squad for the final Test against England in late 2012 after India lost 2 Test matches on the trot to England and conceded the lead in the series. <br/>  <br/> His IPL career started with the Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2008, then he moved to Mumbai Indians to spend two years before being signed once again by the Bangalore franchise in 2011. In the 2014 IPL auctions, he returned to the Mumbai Indians, for whom he played the 2009 and 2010 seasons. He was then signed by the Delhi Daredevils for the 2015 season and continues to mentor them to this day. <br/>  <br/> <b>Twilight</b> <br/> Zaheer Khan was battling fitness issues from a long time. After being dropped from the BCCI's list of contracted players, Zaheer went on to train at a fitness academy in France along with Yuvraj Singh, who was recuperating after his battle with cancer. The 6-month stint did him wonders and he returned leaner and fitter. He announced himself once again and rose through Ranji cricket, picking up 13 wickets in three matches at an average of 19.84 in the 2013 season. One of the major changes he managed to bring about was the ability to bowl long spells and work batsmen out like the days of old. Impressed with the transformation, the selectors rewarded his efforts by naming him in the Test squad to South Africa in December 2013. He was back as the spearhead of the bowling attack, but he only had one decent outing in the two Tests. He also traveled to New Zealand, but his performance remained mediocre. He announced his retirement from the game in 2016 to make way for young legs such as Umesh Yadav and Mohammad Shami.  <br/>  <br/> Zaheer's tendency to break down with injury remained a problem until the very end, and hampered the coherence of a potentially better career. Nevertheless, given his ability to bowl a wide variety of slower deliveries, conventional and reverse-swing, seam, and the ability to adjust his skills to all three brands of ball (Dukes, Kookaburra and SG), Zaheer was a landmark in adaptability. With an astute cricketing mind, and ability to match, he had the perfect blend of brawns and brain. Zaheer Khan was certainly one of the most complete pacers of his era - not something you expect to hear about an Indian fast bowler. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Rishi Roy</b> <br/> <i>As of 13th July 2018</i>",

      "bio": "It's safe to say that Harbhajan's persona had as much impact as his off spin bowling which is actually a compliment to the temperamental Indian hailing from the aggressive Ludhiana region of Punjab. Dismissal from the NCA for indiscipline during his teenage days were a sample of fire that burnt in his belly albeit not always for the right reasons. Neverthless, he had oodles of skills which was unfortunately being buried under the hatchet of off-field dramas. It seemed like his career was going downhill after debuting in 1998. However, Sourav Ganguly, India's captain during the 2000-2005 phase was firm in his backing for getting the Sardar in the squad for the historical 2001 home series against Australia. Harbhajan didn't let his skipper down and took the series by storm with 32 wickets from three Tests including a hat-trick which was the first by an Indian. <br/>  <br/> This was during a time when Anil Kumble was at the peak of his powers and in the coming years Harbhajan formed a lethal spin duo with his senior partner, at times even outbowling the veteran. Due to his better attacking prowess with the bat and arguably better limited-overs approach, Harbhajan soon overtook Kumble in ODIs as the lead spinner of the side. In Tests though, Kumble still was the main man although he did have to fight a battle of his own. Once Kumble retired, the onus was on Harbhajan to carry the flag of spin bowling forward in the Indian team. He did have his moments, not only at home where he was a strike force obviously but also played a good role in some of India's famous overseas Test wins. <br/>  <br/> Despite all this, there is no denying the fact that Harbhajan's career lost track once the IPL came into existence. He had notable success there but while adapting to the frenzied T20 format, he lost that loop and flight which makes a complete spinner. The trajectory had become considerably flatter which definitely made him a more economical bowler but the wickets started to dry up. Statistically, he is India's most successful off spinner but he could have achieved a lot more in the latter half of his career. Even though he wasn't at his best, he played a pivotal role in India's 2011 World Cup glory. The 2010 and 2011 seasons were really torrid for Harbhajan and the emergence of Ashwin meant that the former's position was soon slipping away. <br/>  <br/> Since 2012, Harbhajan has been mostly in and out of the side with Ashwin and Jadeja firming up as the lead spinners in Tests while India have had surplus options in white-ball cricket. All this meant that Harbhajan was restricted to the odd comeback, notably in the 2015-16 season where he played a few Tests and a handful of ODIs apart from getting a chance in the 2016 World T20 as well. Since 2016, he hasn't played for India in any format and it's unlikely that he will ever again. Although yet to officially announce retirement, his career is all but over. Harbhajan also led Mumbai Indians to a Champions League win once. <br/>  <br/> At his best, Harbhajan was pure matchwinner - not only did he cause damage with the ball and occasionally with his big hitting but also got into the skins of the opposition quite a lot of times. No team bore the brunt more than the Australians with whom he had many high profile battles, notably an incident with Ricky Ponting in the late 90s with both still very young. The other one is the infamous Sydney incident with Andrew Symonds where Harbhajan just about got away due to lack of evidence. Even in the IPL, he had his share of issues with the slapping incident of S Sreesanth being the highlight, resulting in him being banned for the rest of the tournament. All these dramas apart, Harbhajan was indeed an enigma in Indian cricket.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> In the latter half of his career, Harbhajan's success has been mostly in the IPL where he played a crucial part in the success of the Mumbai franchise who have won the title thrice. He was a regular member of the team since 2008 and even captained the side. He picked up as many as 24 wickets in the 2013 season and played a vital role in Mumbai's maiden title-winning season. He was also very handy with the bat, scoring a 24-ball 64 against Kings XI Punjab in 2015, a match he tried to win after the top-order was blown away. <br/>  <br/> With time, Harbhajan became a bowler who would be more economical than a really good wicket-taking bowler. After a decade long association, Mumbai released him and he was bought by Chennai Super Kings, for whom he played 13 games in 2018. With more favourable turning tracks at Chepauk, Harbhajan has continued to be a force to reckon with, at least in CSK's home games where he has been strangling opponents. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "Ravichandran Ashwin burst onto the scene with his street-smart exploits in the shorter form of the game at the IPL, but since his Test debut against West Indies in 2011, Ashwin became India's primary spinner, capable of winning matches for his country in every conditions. He might have made a name for himself in the shorter formats of the game to start with, more so in T20 cricket where his accuracy and shrewdness made him a dependable bowler, but it's Test cricket where Ashwin went on to legitimately become one of India's legendary spin bowlers.  <br/>  <br/> A consistent season at the domestic level made him a stand out and got Ashwin a contract with the BCCI in addition to leading Tamil Nadu to victory in the domestic one-day trophy in 2009. When Harbhajan opted out of the first two games against South Africa at home in early 2010, Ashwin was called in as his replacement. Alas he did not get his coveted India Test cap. Impressive performances for the Chennai franchise in the subsequent edition of the IPL meant that he was always knocking on the door and an extended chance arrived in June 2010 when India decided to experiment on their tour to Zimbabwe for a tri-series. <br/>  <br/> After going constantly in and out of the team, the wily off-spinner was picked in the Indian squad for the 2011 World Cup in the Indian subcontinent. However, he played for only two games, including the quarter-final. Ashwin was finally given an extended run in Tests and was adjudged the Man of the Series in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2013, starting his journey as India's go-to bowler on subcontinental pitches with an impressive tally of 29 wickets in the series. In the process he became the third Indian off-spinner to take 25-plus wickets in a series after Harbhajan Singh (32) & Erapalli Prasanna (26). In the first Test match of the home series against West Indies in November 2013, Ashwin got his second Test ton and also put on a record seventh wicket partnership of 280 runs along with Rohit Sharma, going on to get his 100th wicket in his 18th Test - another record. Ashwin had been consistent in the opportunities that he had got and took over as the lead spinner in the Test side after the selectors dropped Harbhajan for the Test series against West Indies in 2011. He formed a successful partnership with left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha and later Ravindra Jadeja, especially in Tests in India. <br/>  <br/> Due to the largely home-centric seasons between 2015 to 2017, Ashwin had consistently performed well, making use of his guile and deception more along with his stock deliveries, rather than experimenting with too many variations. He had finally become a secure enough bowler to trust his off-break and his floater as his stock deliveries and using the carrom ball and other variations sparingly. In overseas conditions, however, he had quite a contrasting and abysmal record and struggled to grip the Kookaburra and extract as much turn on foreign pitches, compared to the SG ball in India. He showed his growth with the Kookaburra on helpful surfaces on the tour of Sri Lanka, where he claimed 21 wickets and played a big hand in India's series win, their first in the island nation since 1993. In the subsequent home season, he continued to mint wickets, looting 31 in 4 home Tests against South Africa. <br/>  <br/> Ashwin played the last two Test matches of the England tour and didn't perform too well with the Dukes whereas his counterpart Moeen performed considerably well against a formidable Indian batting line-up. He also played three Tests in the 2014-15 Border Gavaskar Trophy and showed much better control with the Kookaburra despite not being able to enchant it like he did with the SG in India. He had outstanding series against the West Indies, New Zealand and England at home, snaffling an unparalleled 72 scalps in just 12 Tests. Ashwin had now turned into a complete all-rounder, more-than-handy with the bat and devastating with the ball in familiar conditions. He earned himself the prestigious ICC Test player of the year award as well as the ICC Player of the year award becoming only the second Indian to achieve both in the same year after Rahul Dravid. Later that year, Ashwin went to England to have a county stint and proved to be excellent with the Dukes ball on the allotted surfaces, picking up wickets as though he were bowling in Chennai. During the second Test against Sri Lanka at Nagpur, he became the fastest bowler to 300 Test wickets in his 54th Test, leaving behind Dennis Lillee (56 Tests) and inspiring India's joint-highest Test win by an innings and 239 runs. <br/>  <br/> Ashwin continued to perform consistently for India, especially with the red ball. In 2016, he was named ICC’s Cricketer of the year and he continued to top the charts in ICC’s Test bowling rankings. Forming a formidable duo with Ravindra Jadeja, Ashwin was indomitable in home conditions. After representing India in a second consecutive Cricket World Cup in 2015, Ashwin saw his effectiveness dip in the limited-overs format. While he did eventually lose his place in the white-ball setup as India’s focus shifted to the more attacking wrist-spin of Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav, Ashwin continued to be an integral part of the Test team. Breaking several records along the way, Ashwin established himself as the undisputed leader of India’s spin attack. In March 2022, he surpassed Kapil Dev’s 434 Test wickets to become India’s 2nd highest wicket-taker in Test cricket. In 2021, Ashwin made a surprising comeback to India’s T20 team after being named in the squad for the World T20. His performances weren’t noteworthy but he’d go on to retain his spot in the squad for the next T20 World Cup in 2022 as well.  <br/>  <br/> Ashwin’s experience proved to be crucial for India during the group stages of the 2022 T20 World Cup. He scored the winning runs in a thrilling match against Pakistan at MCG, but he looked toothless after against England in the semi-final and that World Cup exit for India pretty much spelt the exit for Ashwin as well from T20I cricket.  <br/>  <br/> Post the World Cup disappointment, Ashwin returned back home to more familiar pastures, and he was amongst the top performers for India in the 2023 Border Gavaskar Trophy. He picked 25 wickets as India claimed the series and confirmed their spot in the WTC final. Ashwin wasn’t picked for that final, as India were outplayed by Australia. It looked like Ashwin would be relegated to be just a home Tests spinner as he entered the wrong side of thirties, but life had something else planned for him.  <br/>  <br/> An injury to Axar Patel meant that Ashwin was a late inclusion for India in the 2023 ODI World Cup, squeezing into the side off the back of just 3 prior ODI matches against Australia in that year. He played just one match in that World Cup, which was against Australia at Chepauk. In 2024, Ashwin was once again the star bowler for India’s home Tests, as he ended as the leading wicket-taker with 26 wickets against England. A few months later, he scored a superb century against Bangladesh after walking out to bat at 144/6. Ashwin also picked 11 wickets in that series to win a joint record 11 Man of the Series records, also becoming the oldest player to claim a Man of the Series award.  <br/>  <br/> Ashwin was a bit under par in the next home Tests against New Zealand, as he was out bowled by Washington Sundar in the second and third Test. It was followed by a lone appearance in Adelaide during the tour of Australia, following which he announced his international retirement. In a glittering career, Ravi Ashwin finished with 537 Test wickets, second only to Anil Kumble's 619.  <br/>   <br/> <b>IPL - Through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> A rookie from Tamil Nadu, Ravichandran Ashwin, was picked by his home franchise - Chennai Super Kings - in 2009, where he played just two matches. The following season (2010) saw him rise to fame - courtesy his 'sodukku ball' a.k.a. carrom ball. Under MS Dhoni's captaincy, the 'mystery spinner' was summoned to bowl with the new ball and the youngster didn't disappoint his skipper as he finished with 13 wickets at a miserly economy rate of 6.10. Despite heavy competition from Royal Challengers Bangalore, the Super Kings managed to re-buy him for the 2011 season and the offie proved his worth. Ashwin scalped 20 wickets (economy: 6.15, average: 19.40) and he went onto win back-to-back titles for CSK (2010 and 2011). An integral member of the Super Kings set-up, he was retained by the franchise ahead of the 2014 season. <br/>  <br/> While 2014 saw him lose his form a bit, Ashwin came back strongly in the following season. Although he picked just 10 wickets in 16 games during the 2015 season, his economy rate was 5.84, which is incredible in T20s. Following the 2-year-suspension for CSK, Ashwin was picked by Rising Pune Supergiants at the 2016 IPL Player Draft. After having an ordinary outing in 2016, Ashwin was ruled out of the following season due to sports hernia injury. Ashwin had to go under the hammer in 2018 and Kings XI Punjab bought him for Rs 7.6 crore and named him the captain. The season wasn't a success, both for Ashwin and for Punjab as they finished 7th with Ashwin scalping only 10 wickets. A suspected fallout between captain Ashwin and head-coach Anil Kumble led to Kumble’s departure the following season but the Punjab franchise didn’t see much change in fortune under Mike Hesson either in 2019 as they finished 6th this time.  <br/>  <br/> Ashwin was subsequently traded to the Delhi Capitals for the 2020 season. While he was consistently in the mix at Delhi for the following two seasons, there weren’t any performances of note as he finished with 13 and 7 wickets respectively. For the 2021 season, he was bought by the Rajasthan Royals for INR 5 crore.  <br/>  <br/> Ashwin has been used as a defensive bowler by Rajasthan Royals for that IPL cycle, as he formed a good combination with Yuzvendra Chahal. In the 2025 Auctions, Ashwin got a homecoming as he was picked by Chennai Super Kings for a whopping 9.75 crores.  <br/> ",

      "bio": "Very few careers in international cricket have transcended the boundaries of myth as that of Ravindra Jadeja, nicknamed 'Sir'. The nickname initially trended more as a joke but the young man from Saurashtra took all the criticism and mock comments in his stride to turn the tables in spectacular fashion. A disastrous 2009 World T20 made him the laughing stock, particularly among the naturally combustible Indian fans who were baying for his blood back home. The 2009-10 season went haywire for the young man whose only solace was the immense backing from his skipper MS Dhoni who was adamant in his support of the all-rounder.  <br/>  <br/> A few quiet seasons followed and Jadeja unassumingly pegged away at the domestic circuit. Although known as a proper all-rounder there, it was evident that he was a more effective bowler, having the ability to hit a spot with relentless accuracy. Batting skills were no less - he has three triple tons in first-class cricket - that sums up things, doesn't it? Jadeja was slowly working his way in limited-overs cricket but clearly, it was his Test debut that changed his fortunes in a big way. His initiation in red-ball cricket came in a dead rubber of the home series against England in 2012-13. However, a fairly decent debut meant that he was retained when the Australians toured India in early 2013. Jadeja starred in that series along with the lead spinner Ravichandran Ashwin as India recorded a historic whitewash over the Aussies. <br/>  <br/> The same year he shone in India's Champions Trophy title glory, gaining the Golden Ball for his terrific bowling performances in the tournament. That international season was an emphatic statement - Jadeja had arrived. Since then, he hasn't looked back, becoming a force to reckon with in Tests, particularly in the sub-continent as India charged to number one in the rankings. His association with Ashwin has dismantled many opposition batting line-ups and is easily the best spin attack in the world. Injuries did hamper his form in the shorter formats and the new rule changes post the 2015 World Cup saw him being ineffective in white-ball cricket. Ashwin also struggled and the duo found themselves out of the limited-overs squads post the 2017 Champions Trophy. <br/>  <br/> India did finish runners-up in the showpiece event but there was a feeling that the vaunted Test partnership of Ashwin-Jadeja wasn't being replicated in white-ball cricket. The advent of wrist spinners has made things tough although Jadeja's multi-dimensional skills does keep him in the hunt. He is arguably India's best fielder and can tonk a few with the bat apart from his bowling skills. Supreme fitness levels also meant he was always on the radar for national selection whenever there was an opportunity. He returned to the ODI setup for the 2018 Asia Cup and played a sizeable amount of games since then, although he was dropped for a few as well. The all-round package that he is, Jadeja is a tough candidate for a captain to ignore because he is a live wire in the field, bowls decent spin and can give those extra few runs towards the end overs. Recurring injuries to Hardik Pandya in the 2018-19 season gave a new lease of life to Jadeja's white-ball dreams and he cemented his spot in the squad, featuring at no.7 whenever Hardik missed out and taking one of the specialist spinner slots when the latter returned. Jadeja's batting in Tests has also hit a peak over the last few years, making him a very reliable batsman irrespective of conditions. <br/>  <br/> He has been an all format player for India into his 30s as well. Jadeja was part of the 2023 ODI World Cup as well as the 2024 T20 World Cup. He announced his retirement from T20Is shortly after India became champions. Jadeja has been a steady eddy for India in limited overs cricket, and has been a proven match winner in home Tests.  <br/>  <br/> Jadeja was part of the Indian team that won the Champions Trophy in 2025, performing consistently throughout the tournament.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> Jadeja's rise does have a lot to do with Dhoni's undying support but it was actually the IPL that found the Saurashtra boy - or rather the legendary Shane Warne to be precise. As captain of the Rajasthan Royals, the Australian spotted Jadeja's prowess and had said back in 2008-09 that this 'Rockstar' would go places. He wasn't wrong at all. After featuring for Rajasthan briefly, Jadeja became an integral part of the Chennai outfit till the squad was briefly suspended after the 2015 season. During the side's two-year hiatus, its players were scattered across and Jadeja found himself with his native Gujarat franchise - a temporary side. With the Chennai squad returning from the 2018 season onwards, he was among the three people retained - proof enough of how much he is valued there. <br/>  <br/> After an outstanding 2021 IPL where he scored 227 runs and took 13 wickets, Jadeja was hot property ahead of the 2022 mega auction. CSK splurged INR 16 crore to acquire his services and made him captain. But after just 2 wins in their first 8 games, Jadeja handed back the captaincy to MS Dhoni to concentrate on his own game. He was subsequently ruled out of the season due to a rib injury. After reports of a rift between the franchise and Jadeja, the allrounder was reportedly spoken to and returned for the 2023 season. <br/>  <br/> Jadeja had a fairly quiet IPL season in 2023, but had his moment in the sun in the final against Gujarat Titans. With 10 runs needed off 2 deliveries, Jadeja whacked Mohit Sharma for a six and a four to etch his name forever in CSK folklore. The following season, Jadeja performed consistently despite CSK missing out on a spot in the playoffs. He was retained ahead of the 2025 mega auctions and will be back in CSK colours once again.  <br/>  <br/> <b>By Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "In an Indian team desperately searching for a death overs' bowler, Jasprit Bumrah came to the fore through the Indian Premier League, as a boon for cricket in the country. The scantily-built pacer from Gujarat has managed to perfect the art of bowling inch-perfect yorkers as an understudy to Lasith Malinga as a part of the Mumbai Indians franchise and has grown into an indispensable asset for the Indian team in the limited-overs format.  <br/>  <br/> Having been a consistent performer in the domestic circuit, Bumrah has been a menace to the batsmen at the Ranji level since his debut. His quick-arm action has made his variations almost indiscernible - starting from his slower deliveries to his reverse-swinging yorkers at the death. An injury kept him out of action for a while in the 2014/15 seasons but he returned and continued to perform unaffected by the injury break. A national call-up seemed to be just around the corner.  <br/>  <br/> The inevitable call came at last as Bumrah travelled with the Indian team to Australia as an injury-replacement for Mohammad Shami, eventually making his debut in the dead rubber at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He has delivered consistent performances in coloured clothing and has since become an irreplaceable asset for his captain, consistently holding his nerve and becoming MS Dhoni's bowling counterpart as a last-over specialist for India. He went on to perform commendably for a young fast bowler in India's next world events - the ICC Champions' Trophy in 2017, where he only took 4 wickets in 5 matches, but conceded at an economy rate of just 5 runs an over, particularly impressive for a death overs' specialist.  <br/>  <br/> Only one question remained. Can Bumrah become an effective Test bowler? He has shown appetite and ability for red-ball cricket, bowling Gujarat to their maiden Ranji Trophy title, in 2016-17. However, the Kookaburra ball posed a whole new challenge. He was handed the elusive Test cap in January 2018 in South Africa, and showed his adaptability with his skiddy nippers and unpredictable scrambled-seamers, proving to be the find of the tour for India - in other words, a good start in Tests for the versatile Bumrah. <br/>  <br/> In the season to follow, Bumrah's reputation would grow staggeringly as he would take Test cricket by storm in just his first year in whites. With sensational performances in England and Australia, he broke the record for the most wickets taken in overseas Tests by an Indian bowler in a single year. <br/> Bumrah was India’s talismanic bowler at the 2019 ODI World Cup, ending as his team’s leading wicket-taker with 18 scalps to his name. Shortly after the World Cup, Bumrah took a Test hat-trick against West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica. The workload of being a three format player finally started affecting Bumrah, as he suffered a stress fracture to his back and missed the bulk of the white ball 2021 and 2022 cricket seasons. He missed two T20I World Cups for India, but starred for India in Tests as he was the leading wicket-taker in the 2021 tour to England. Bumrah also got a chance to captain India in the 5th Test against England where he scored 29 runs in an over off Stuart Broad, which remains a record in Test cricket.  <br/>  <br/> Bumrah made a full recovery in 2023, right in time for the ODI World Cup. He was superb in that tournament too as India stormed their way into the final, before being outplayed by Australia. In 2024, he troubled England with reverse sweep and some toe crushing yorkers in the Test series which India won 4-1. Bumrah was selected for the 2024 T20I World Cup as well. He produced match winning performances against Pakistan in the group stage and against South Africa in the final, as India won both those games from losing positions to end their trophy drought since 2013. He produced two balls of the tournament in that final - one to dismiss Hendricks and one to dismiss Marco Jansen, and was rightly named as Player of the Series in that World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Later in that year, Bumrah got a chance to lead India once again for the first Test against Australia in Perth. He produced a fast bowling spell for the years in Perth as India registered one of their most iconic away wins to start the series on a winning note. A fast bowler with freakish accuracy, a lethal yorker and a calm mind that revels at the biggest stage, Jasprit Bumrah has undoubtedly already become one of India’s best ever to play the game. The real question is how far can this smiling assassin go with a good chunk of his cricketing career still ahead of him.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> One of the many things the IPL can boast of is being a feeder system of emerging talent. It provides a platform for unheard players to make themselves known, to throw their hat in the ring as far as national reckoning goes. And no one exemplifies this better than Jasprit Bumrah, probably the IPL's biggest gift to Indian cricket. <br/>  <br/> Bumrah built his reputation by being different. A short run-up followed by a snappy bowling action with his arms rigid as bones, where it seems like everything could go wrong, right up until the point when it doesn't. His reliability is what surprisingly started to stand out amid the mayhem of the IPL. Under the guidance of a death-bowling expert like Lasith Malinga, Bumrah flourished. He made his debut in the 2013 edition of the competition, where he barely got much game time, but would quickly go on to become a regular in the MI playing eleven in the seasons to follow, surprising batsmen with the pace he generated off his wrist. <br/>  <br/> By 2017, he had established himself as the team's go-to bowler, even ahead of Malinga, evidenced by the decision to give him the responsibility of a Super Over against the Gujarat Lions, where he justified the call by defending 12 runs against Brendon McCullum and Aaron Finch. In that same year, Bumrah bowled MI into the finals through a match-winning spell of 3/7 in three overs in the second Qualifier against KKR, and then played a big part in clinching the trophy for Mumbai just when it seemed that Pune would cruise home. <br/>  <br/> It came as no surprise that Bumrah was one of the three players to be retained by MI for 2018. And he repaid the faith by finishing the season as the team's top wicket-taker, with an economy of under 7 - the first time he'd done that. <br/>  <br/> In the 2019 season, Bumrah was the leading wicket-taker with 19 wickets as Mumbai won a thrilling final against Chennai Super Kings. Bumrah was in sublime form in the 2020 Covid season as well, picking up 27 wickets. He was the second highest wicket-taker of the tournament, behind only Kagiso Rabada. Mumbai Indians defended their IPL title that season.  <br/>  <br/> Bumrah was the leading wicket-taker for Mumbai in the 2021 and 2022 season as well, but the team’s performances were subpar and MI failed to make it to the playoffs. In 2023, Bumrah was ruled out of the IPL due to a back injury. He was back at his best in the 2024 season, picking 20 wickets and ending as MI’s leading wicket-taker for the season. Bumrah got his 150th IPL wicket in the 2024 season in a game against Delhi Capitals, where he finished with figures of 5/21.  <br/>  <br/> Ahead of the mega auction, Bumrah was retained by Mumbai Indians and will be their most expensive player for 2025.

      "bio": " <br/> Hailing from a background of high academic standards, KL Rahul was born and brought up in the prestigious National Institute of Technology Karnataka, where his father is a professor in the department of Civil Engineering. He finished his schooling in NITK and grew to develop keen interest in cricket. Having started off with batting on the grass-less field of the college, Rahul's parents spotted a spark in him and decided that he must receive formal training in order to realize his talents.  <br/>  <br/> Rahul rose through the ranks of Under-19 cricket and broke into the Karnataka first-class side and had a decent debut season in 2010-11. He was left out of the squad for the succeeding season, but he returned for the 2012-13 season, in which he had a prolific run of form, becoming the highest run-getter of the season, propelling himself into contention for the highest honour of them all – an India Test cap.  <br/>  <br/> The prospect of a debut on a momentous occasion like the Boxing Day at the MCG against the world's chirpiest team seemed to throw Rahul off his game, as he crumbled under pressure and lost his wicket to two shots unbecoming (to say the least) of a Test player. With the series already lost, and in a manifestation of compassion for Rahul's nervous jitters, the selectors and the captain decided to give Rahul a go at his usual opening spot in the Sydney Test. He had a dramatic redemption in Sydney as he stroked his way to a patient century, proving that he belongs in the national side – to himself, more than anyone else.  <br/>  <br/> This hundred gave Rahul some momentum, and he went on to make hundreds in Sri Lanka and West Indies on away tours, making the opening combination a dilemma for the Indian selectors. He showed his tendency to convert starts, making his first three fifty-plus scores count, and going on to score a hundred each time. However, he continued to have anxious starts and got the reputation of an 'all-or-nothing' player.  <br/>  <br/> Rahul was selected in the limited-overs squads to Zimbabwe and West Indies in mid-2016. It was then that Rahul showed his versatility across formats, bursting forth with a hundred each on ODI and T20I debut, after a fine run in the IPL for the Royal Challengers Bangalore. The young right-hander got a chance to play his first home Test, but a series of injuries and recurrences managed to keep him going in and out of the playing XI until the Chennai Test against England in late 2017 when he made a full recovery. He went on to make a heart-breaking 199 in Chennai; his current highest score in Test cricket.  <br/>  <br/> With an ideal mentor in Rahul Dravid, KL Rahul shares more than his first name with the Indian legend; the dogged resistance, the compact, airtight technique, and the unimpeachable focus at the crease are all common factors between the two batting technicians. Rahul does need to work a tad more on his nerves, though, after his tame dismissal on 199 in Chennai further reinforced his image as a timorous player. However, with age on his side, Rahul can work on his nerves and with an all-conditions' technique to go with it, he is an exciting prospect for India's long and challenging overseas season and he would like to reinforce his spot as a long-term option for India as a premier Test opener. <br/>  <br/> In 2018, following a superb IPL, Rahul got a route back in the T20I side and he scored a superb century against England at Old Trafford. He was picked in the 2019 World Cup, where he initially played at number 4 but an injury to Shikhar Dhawan forced him to switch to opener. Rahul has been a consistent white ball performer for India, but his Test match form dipped. His inconsistency meant that he was chopped in and out the side, and slotted in occasionally as an opener and occasionally as a middle order batter, especially when he was picked as a wicketkeeper batter.  <br/>  <br/> Rahul scored two quality hundreds away against England and South Africa, but failed to replicate that consistently and was often the first player slotted out of the Indian Test team while the entire batting unit suffered a dip in form.  <br/>  <br/> Post 2022, KL Rahul was asked to drop down to number 5 in ODI cricket to accommodate Shubman Gill who started opening for India. The decision proved to work wonders as it unlocked a new level to KL Rahul’s cricket, as he revelled in the role of anchor and finisher for Indian cricket. In that phase, Rahul used to open for India in T20s, playing the 2021 and 2022 WC as opener, while playing in the middle order in ODIs.  <br/>  <br/> Rahul was in fine form during the 2023 ODI World Cup. He rescued India after being 2 for 3 in their opening game against Australia, scoring an unbeaten 97. Rahul was superb with the gloves as well. He was India’s top scorer in the World Cup final as well, but unfortunately the result didn’t go India’s way. Post the World Cup, Rahul has suffered a couple of injuries and not been a consistent part of the team, as he has also suffered a dip in form. He however has continued to get the backing of skipper Rohit Sharma and coach Gautam Gambhir, and retained his place for the Test tour to Australia.  <br/>  <br/> He was tasked to open for India once again in the first Test at Perth, due to the absence of Rohit Sharma. Rahul impressed one and all with a solid defensive technique as he scored a fifty to give India a solid start in the second innings.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL Through the Years</b> <br/> Rahul was picked by his home team of RCB as a 20-year-old rookie in 2013. He played five games that season but failed to really make an impact. Rahul was sent back into the auction and was picked by Sunrisers Hyderabad for 2014. After two mediocre years for SRH, he was back with RCB for 2016 where he was the wicketkeeper-batter. Rahul scored 397 runs that season at an average of 44.11 and helped RCB reach the final.  <br/>  <br/> Rahul missed the 2017 season due to an injury, and returned in the mega auction of 2018. He was picked for a massive 11 crores by Punjab Kings who gave him a free hand as opener. Rahul scored 659 runs at a strike rate of 158.41 that season, and also got the then fastest IPL fifty when he got there off just 14 balls. After two seasons at the franchise, Rahul was elevated to the role of captain. He was Punjab’s leading run scorer all throughout his tenure with the franchise, but he was criticised for having a slower strike rate in his later years. He also couldn’t help Punjab qualify for the playoffs in his years as captain.  <br/>  <br/> In 2022, when the IPL became a 10-team tournament, he moved to Lucknow Super Giants where also he was the captain. Under Rahul’s captaincy, LSG made the playoffs in his first two seasons, but failed at the eliminator stage. In his third season, Lucknow finished 7th. Ahead of the mega auctions, he was released by LSG and Rahul will now be seen in the colours of Delhi Capitals in IPL 2025.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Written by Rishi Roy</b>",

      "bio": "Shikhar Dhawan shot to fame after an unprecedented run in the 2004 U-19 World Cup, where he scored 505 runs garnished with 3 hundreds. However, it took him a long while to make it to the Indian team due to the large amount of competition at the time. A naturally attacking left-handed opener, Dhawan had been one of the mainstays of the Delhi line-up for a long time and forms an impregnable top-order along with Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag, scoring runs by the barrel along with them. He was rated quite highly by experts for his ability to dig in and play the big innings. <br/>  <br/> Dhawan, with his side-on stance and negligible trigger movement, is strong on the off-side with his cuts and drives. His game against spin and the ability to come down the track to attack, and the prowess to score in big games and big tournaments made Dhawan a mainstay in the Indian limited overs team for a long time. A natural stroke-player, Dhawan has the gift of picking the line of the ball early and the length of the ball, allowing him ample time to get into position for any shot that he wishes to play. <br/>  <br/> After a string of excellent domestic performances, he was handed an India debut against Australia in 2010. He scored a duck and made no significant contributions for a while, as he continued to be the quintessential replacement player in the side. However, given the controversial axing of Virender Sehwag after the second Test, Dhawan was handed the desirable India Test cap to make his debut against the Australians in March 2013. He had a start that he wouldn't have imagined in his wildest dreams as he raced away to the fastest ever hundred on debut off just 85 balls, and continued to score at will on a docile Mohali surface. Shikhar Dhawan continues to hold the record for the highest score by an Indian on Test debut, smashing 185 runs before being dismissed in the first innings. <br/>  <br/> Dhawan had a purple patch in 2013, and continued his form in ODIs and emerging as the player of the tournament in the ICC Champions Trophy in June 2013. He blazed away to 363 runs in just five games, including two hundreds. When Australia toured India in October 2013, Dhawan was relentless in his pursuit of runs as he slammed a ton and two fifties, finishing with 284 runs in six matches. He continued his good run in the home series against West Indies as well, becoming the highest run-getter for India in the calendar year. <br/>  <br/> Dhawan had a dismal Test series against South Africa in 2013 and an even worse one in England in 2014, with a best of 37 in six innings, where his problems outside off were exposed, as he committed to the line of the ball too early, thereby ending up not accounting for the lateral movement and had a tendency of chasing the ball. He continued to struggle in Tests barring a rather scratchy 81 in the second innings of the Brisbane Test, Dhawan did not get any significant scores in the 2014-15 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Due to his technical deficiencies, he forfeited his spot to KL Rahul. However, in limited-overs cricket, where the pitches are true and all is rosy, Dhawan continued to prosper. <br/>  <br/> Against all odds, Dhawan started off the 2015 World Cup with a fluent 72 against arch-rivals Pakistan and a glorious and skillful 137 at the MCG against South Africa, looking like a different player and playing all kinds of shots against the likes of Morkel and Steyn, helping his side gain their first victory over South Africa in a World Cup encounter. The pace and bounce of the Australian pitches appeared to have undone Dhawan, but the true bounce and the lack of lateral movement meant that he could get into his zone and start to play close to his body again, ending the tournament with 412 runs. Dhawan and Rohit managed to set the platform every time for three hundred-plus totals with their solid first-wicket partnerships. <br/>  <br/> Dhawan has struggled for form in the longer format, with some small chinks in his armour such as the tendency of poking outside off and playing beside the line of the ball at all times rather than over it. Some of the virtues that work for him in the limited form, such as playing close to his body, do not work for him in the longer format because of the parallax error that he undergoes since he doesn't get his eyes over the ball while playing it.  <br/>  <br/> However, Dhawan continued to remain India's go-to man in ODIs and delivered another fine performance in an ICC event, making him a specialist for the big stage in the limited-overs format. Despite his limitations, his carefree attitude and his explosive off-side shots, one can't help but draw comparisons with another maverick opener from Delhi. The ability to peak during ICC events made him an almost indispensable asset to the side in limited -overs cricket - a rather theatrical oddity in his career with the utopian twist of opportune comebacks.  <br/>  <br/> His luck though eventually faded out come the turn of the decade, with age and slowly down reflexes catching up to him. Although Dhawan was named stand-in captain for a few tours when Rohit Sharma was rested, he failed to set the stage on fire. A dipping strike rate and an inability to convert starts into big scorers consistently paved the path for Shubman Gill to be picked as ODI opener to pair-up with Rohit Sharma with Dhawan slowly being phased out.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> The Indian Premier League came at exactly the right time in Shikhar Dhawan's cricket career. He wasn't quite the star back then in 2008 but his credentials as a cricketer was good enough to earn him an IPL contract. Dhawan was picked up by Delhi Daredevils and he played in a star-studded team alongside Sehwag, Gambhir, de Villiers, Dilshan, and Collingwood in 2008. Shikhar batted at the vital number-3 spot and ended up as the third highest run-getter with 340 runs in 14 matches. <br/>  <br/> In a bizarre decision, Delhi let Shikhar go to Mumbai in the next season. And the move to Mumbai Indians proved to be a disaster for Dhawan. In two seasons for MI, Shikhar only played 15 matches. In 2009, he played 5 matches and averaged 10 and in the next edition, he could only make 191 runs in 10 matches. After two dismal seasons, Dhawan moved to Sunrisers Hyderabad and that decision transformed Shikhar's career, he found back his consistency and became one of the key assets for Deccan Chargers first and then for Sunrisers Hyderabad. Soon, he was selected for the Indian team and since then he has been one of the top performers for India as well as for his IPL franchise. <br/>  <br/> Ahead of the 2019 IPL auctions, Shikhar was traded by Sunrisers Hyderabad. They sold him to Delhi and in return got Vijay Shankar, Abhishek Sharma, and Shahbaz Nadeem. So, after a gap of 11 years, Shikhar went on to represent the Delhi franchise once again and ended the first season as the leading run getter for the Capitals, with five fifties to his name. The 2020 season was no different, in fact it proved to be better for Shikhar Dhawan as he ended as the second highest run scorer in the competition, as he scored his first IPL ton and then became the first player ever in IPL history to record back-to-back hundreds. Dhawan’s efforts helped DC reach the final, where they were beaten by arguably the best franchise side ever assembled in Mumbai Indians.   <br/>  <br/> In the 2021 season, Dhawan still remained the top run getter for Delhi Capitals, but his average dipped a bit and he could only manage three fifties that season. Ahead of the mega auctions, Dhawan was released with the franchise opting to retain younger players. Dhawan was the first player picked in the mega auction, with Punjab Kings raising their baton for him. He struggled to match his lofty standards in the 2022 season, as he was transitioning to become more of an anchor player. Nevertheless, he was top scorer for PBKS and he was subsequently retained and also made team captain for the next season with Mayank Agarwal being released.  <br/>  <br/> <b>World Cup through the years</b> <br/> The Ultimate ICC event player. Shikhar Dhawan is the individual equivalent of the Australian team post the 1999 World Cup - regardless of merit or form, he has a knack of attaining his peak form just before World events. Such was the case ahead of the 2019 World Cup, where an incredible IPL season a few months earlier made him the mainstay for the International side. Dhawan started with a bang, as he scored a sensational match-defining hundred against Australia in the group stages despite nursing a finger injury sustained during the match. That finger injury proved to be a fracture which ruled out Dhawan from the World Cup, with KL Rahul being asked to deputize as opener for the rest of the tournament.  In India's 2015 World Cup campaign, Dhawan was the team’s highest run-getter with 412 runs, scoring at an average in excess of 50, with two crucial knocks in pressure games against major teams - 137 against South Africa, and a useful 73 against Pakistan.",

      "bio": "A wiry young lad from a small town in Gujarat, Hardik Pandya, with his tattoos and peroxide highlights, encapsulates the charisma and swagger of the modern-day Indian cricketer. The all-rounder was propelled into the big stage after constant exposure to prime-time television in the form of the Indian Premier League. A deep voice to go with the confidence and energy, and showing no sign of playing it safe, Pandya is the modern icon of audacity in the Indian side. Having gone through the hard grind of domestic cricket, Pandya shot to fame when he was picked up by an IPL franchise - a license to make his talent well-known on the big stage. <br/>  <br/> As several youngsters do in the modern era, Pandya announced himself to the world during the IPL, portraying his swashbuckling ability to strike the ball, outstanding fielding, and some street-smart bowling that transcends the cliché 'just rolls his arm over'. He made the world sit up when he soaked in the pressure and came good in crunch situations, playing a pivotal role in the Mumbai franchise's second title triumph, and winning two Man of the Match awards on his way. The Indian public and critics, who never fail to make comparisons, immediately had the inevitable question at the tip of their tongue: Had India found their first fast-bowling all-rounder since Kapil Dev? <br/>  <br/> Despite being predominantly noted for his explosive batting, Pandya is no slouch with the ball. In fact, it was his all-round skills which caught the attention of the T20 franchises during the Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament culminating a national contract. Pandya's merit was duly rewarded when he was named in India's ODI squad for the home series against New Zealand in 2016. By this time, he had worked on his swing bowling skills, and was hitting the 140s regularly, troubling the batsmen with his nagging length. In fact, having been a part of the 2016 World T20, Pandya defended an equation reading '2 to win off 3' against Bangladesh, bowling back of a length and short on a slow-ish wicket, and keeping India alive in the tournament as a result. <br/>  <br/> Pandya is relatively new to the Indian team and has already played some excellent knocks with the bat in ODIs, sealing off some tight run-chases and scoring quick runs when required. With the ability to surge when required and target a particular bowler, he has pulled off 20-run overs in pressure situations and remains a vital cog in the ODI fold. With an ageing MS Dhoni shifting into a sheet anchor mode rather than his usual swashbuckling mode, Pandya is a crucial factor in the team and can form a vital pairing with Dhoni, by batting around his stability as his apprentice to finish off games. His technique though, however useful in ODIs, isn't the best for non-true wickets, and if he chooses the path of Test cricket, he needs to make himself more compact and solid in terms of batting fundamentals. His bowling has taken giant strides, as he has perfected the art of swing and has figured out the optimal trajectory for his speed as well to impart maximum lateral movement on the ball. <br/>  <br/> Regardless of whether Pandya is India's next Kapil Dev, he certainly beings a much-needed balance to the side. If he remains grounded in the midst of all the glamour, and shapes his game under the able guidance of his seniors and coaches, he is destined for greatness. As of right now, it will be fascinating to watch the exuberance of blending with the maturity that comes with experience as the nation looks up at this charismatic young talent in its quest for those elusive overseas wins. <br/>  <br/> After a grueling 2018, Pandya has come out a more mature cricketer, starting from his happy-go-lucky 93 in Cape Town, to his 5-for and half-century in India's only win in the Test series against England. Pandya's bowling, particularly in Tests, has come a long way, with his extra bounce from a back of a length, and particularly his ability to swing the ball away from the right-hander. Despite not bowling the best deliveries at times, he does seem to have an uncanny knack of dismissing set batsmen, perhaps even established batsmen. His batting, although extremely aggressive, still needs a lot of work as he continues to exhibit a single-dimensional, all-out attack mode to his batting - an approach that has often failed in more bowler-friendly conditions. <br/>  <br/> After a mixed year of glory and heartbreak, Pandya was hampered by a severe back injury during the Asia Cup in 2018 which ruled him out of the tour of Australia. To make things worse, he received a lot of flak when an episode of a talk show aired in India, in which Pandya, along with Rahul, were called out for their misogynistic comments about women, and were suspended by the Board of Control for Cricket in India for poor conduct and tarnishing the image of Indian cricket. The ban has been lifted since the incident. Pandya, however, returned to the side after a lot of internal conflict in the board, for the ODI series against New Zealand and performed admirably, particularly with the ball and in the field. He remains a vital cog in India's 2019 World Cup plans, providing a much-needed balance in the side, as India finally manage to get their hands on a fast-bowling all-rounder for the first time since the Great Kapil Dev.  <br/>  <br/> Pandya was crucial in the 2019 World Cup as an auxiliary bowler, and made some handy contributions with the bat as well against Pakistan and England. However, India crashed out in the semis against New Zealand and post that World Cup exit came a tumultuous time in Pandya’ life.  <br/>  <br/> Workload management became an issue for the lanky all rounder, as he constantly picked up injuries and wasn’t able to bowl his full quota of overs. He played the bulk of the 2021 IPL as a specialist batter and bowled sparingly in the 2021 T20 World Cup as well, as India crashed out in the group stages.  <br/>  <br/> Pandya was dropped from the side and also suffered a back injury in that time period for which he had to go under the knife. The next few months saw the flashy all-rounder work massively on his fitness and diet. On his return, he looked a lot more muscular and war ready - Hardik Pandya 2.0 was upon us!  <br/>  <br/> In 2022, Hardik Pandya was roped in by new franchise Gujarat Titans in the IPL and he was made skipper. He was a revelation as captain as he shared the new ball responsibilities with Shami, batted up the order and was an excellent man manager as well. Gujarat Titans won the IPL in their inaugural season, as Hardik Pandya claimed a three-fer in that final. In the 2023 season, Gujarat Titans reached the final and were only foiled by a Ravindra Jadeja masterclass as he scored 10 runs off the last two balls to snatch the final away for CSK.  <br/>  <br/> Alongside the successes he was achieving as a franchise captain, Hardik Pandya also seemed rejuvenated as an all-rounder. He seemed to easily manage bowling plenty of overs for his side and then aced the role of a finisher with the bat, becoming a vital cog in the Indian setup once again. Pandya played a crucial knock alongside Kohli in the 2022 T20 World Cup against Pakistan, as India resurrected an unlikely looking chase against their arch rivals. Pandya was top scorer in the semi-final against England as well. <br/>  <br/> In the 2023 World Cup, Hardik Pandya injured his ankle in a group game against Bangladesh and was ruled out of the tournament. That injury forced India to rejig their team composition, and many believe that Hardik Pandya was perhaps the missing link in that final where India lost to Australia.   <br/>  <br/> In 2024, Hardik Pandya was transferred back to Mumbai Indians, and he was appointed as captain of the franchise - displacing long standing skipper Rohit Sharma. That decision made him public enemy number 1 as he was booed and ridiculed across stadiums, often by fans of his own franchise. Pandya himself had a dismal IPL as Mumbai finished well outside the playoff positions.  <br/>  <br/> A month or so later though Hardik Pandya had his day of reckoning as he was tasked with bowling the final over for India in the T20 World Cup final against South Africa. He successfully defended 16 runs in that final over as India won an ICC trophy for the first time in 11 years. Hardik Pandya was serenaded back home after that trophy triumph, annulled of all his previous ‘sins.’  <br/>  <br/> Hardik Pandya was a key part of the Indian setup in their 2025 Champions Trophy triumph as well. He partnered well with Shami as the only other seam bowling option and played some crucial cameos against New Zealand and Australia as India won a second ICC title in a span of 9 months.  <br/>  <br/> by <b>Rishi Roy</b> <br/> ",

      "bio": "At 19, Rishabh Pant has gone through all the highs and lows of a cricketing career. A promising talent from Delhi, Pant came into reckoning after his exploits for India Under-19 in the 2016 World Cup. A dashing left-handed wicket-keeper batsman, he lit up the tournament with a blitzing 24-ball 75, the fastest half-century of the tournament, against Nepal and followed it up with a century against Namibia. India lost the title round - but came back with several positives - nothing bigger than the emergence of Pant.  <br/>  <br/> Pant's heroics didn't go unnoticed, and days after his Nepal stunner, he was drafted in by the Delhi Daredevils in the IPL auctions. He gained a permanent place in Delhi's domestic circuit and by the end of the season was even named as their captain, albeit for the one-day format of the game. In between, he made his full India debut, against England in a Twenty20 international in Bengaluru.  <br/>  <br/> The second Ranji season for Rishabh wasn't as good as the first one. But he made up for that in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. He smashed the second fastest hundred in the T-20 history in just 32 balls against Himachal Pradesh. This knock brought him into the selectors reckoning again and he was named in the Nidhas Trophy team.  <br/>  <br/> Pant again had a disappointing outing in his comeback match. He hasn't been himself at the international level and often tried to hit the ball too hard to his liking and failed to portray his hitting prowess. Strangely, his strike rate in the International T20 is just over 100 which is well below average for a power hitter. <br/>  <br/> With Saha nursing a finger injury, Pant made his Test debut against England in 2018, and he got off the mark with a six on debut. In the final Test at the Oval, Pant scored a superb century as he stitched together a partnership with KL Rahul in the fourth innings that nearly took the game away from England.  <br/>  <br/> A few months later, Pant found himself as the first choice keeper for the tour to Australia. He was superb in that series as well, scoring a century in Sydney as India won an away Test series against Australia for the first time. In June 2019, Pant was picked midway as a replacement player for Shikhar Dhawan for the ODI World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Post the World Cup and the subsequent retirement of MS Dhoni, Pant was the first choice keeper across formats. He suffered a dip in form though and was in and out of the side, while his batting position was switched around in white ball cricket. KL Rahul was at times picked at the keeper during that period as Pant was relegated towards the fringes of Indian cricket.  <br/>  <br/> He was part of the Test squad for the 2020-21 Border Gavaskar Trophy, but wasn’t part of the XI for the first Test as Saha was preferred over him. India lost the first Test with the ignominious 36 all out, and that called for a few changes in the side. That prompted Pant to get a way back into the team, and he proved to be the difference for the rest of the series. The southpaw scored a counter attacking 97 in Sydney in the fourth innings as India saved a tricky Test match.  <br/>  <br/> In the fourth Test, India were rank underdogs due to injuries, playing against a full strength Australia who hadn’t lost in Gabba since two decades. The chips were stacked against India to chase 328 on the final day, but Pant played a spellbinding knock of 89* to give India a famous match and series win away to Australia.  <br/>  <br/> Pant was superb in the home series against England as well, counter attacking the opposition spinners as India came from a Test down to win the series 3-1. In December 2022, Pant suffered an unfortunate car accident which left him with some serious knee and back injuries. He was out of cricket for more than a year, and made a miraculous recovery to not only get back onto his feet but also to be able to return to the cricket field ahead of IPL 2024.  <br/>  <br/> His athleticism and range of play remained unaffected even post the accident, as Pant was back to his swashbuckling best. Pant was picked for the 2024 T20 World Cup, and played all games as India won the trophy. Despite suffering a ghastly injury, Pant has not only managed a full recovery but has managed to claim his spot as an all format cricketer for India, who still has a lot to offer to the world of cricket.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> The expertise that the IPL demands and the skill set that Rishabh Pant posses are absolutely in synchronization. If ever the definition of an ideal T20 batsman would be written, Rishabh Pant would tick most of the aspects. He is a ferocious hitter of the cricket ball wide a wide array of shots and can clear the boundary ropes with ridiculous ease. The scoops, the paddles, the flicks, you name it and this bloke has every shot in his repertoire. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> His career so far is an epitome of the Indian Premier League's timeline 'where talent meets opportunity.' Rishabh was picked up by Delhi Daredevils at a whopping price of 1.9 Crores in the 2016 auction. His first season didn't pan out the way Rishabh would have liked but he definitely vindicated the owners trust in 2017. A breakthrough season and Rishabh Pant had well and truly arrived. Going into the second season of the IPL, his confidence was sky-high and there were talks of an imminent India cap for the 2017 Champions Trophy. But life had another twist for the young batsman. Days before his team's first match - against Royal Challengers Bangalore, his father passed away, leaving a void difficult to fill. He came back to cricket from the tragedy, nearly guided his team home with a single-handed effort, and later blasted a blinding 97 against Gujarat Lions to finish the tournament with 366 runs.    <br/>  <br/> Rishabh was retained for the third season and he proved to be Delhi's only shining light in otherwise a pretty dark campaign. Throughout the season, Pant was responsible for demolishing the morale of the bowlers. His innings of 125 against SRH was one for the ages. The manner in which he took world-class Bhuvneshwar apart was a testimony to his grand stature as a T20 batsman. He will churn out for Delhi Capitals this year with an immense amount of international experience under his belt. And he would very well know a stellar season can fetch him a ticket to England for the World Cup.   <br/>  <br/> In 2021, Pant was chosen as captain for Delhi Capitals as their usual skipper Shreyas Iyer was out due to a shoulder injury. He continued to retain the captaincy even after Iyer returned for the second half of the IPL. He captained Delhi for the next couple of seasons in the IPL as well, but DC failed to make it to the playoffs consistently. Pant was retained by Delhi despite him not being able to play in IPL 2023. Ahead of the 2025 auctions, he was released by Delhi Capitals and he became the most expensive player at 27 crores when he was picked by Lucknow Super Giants.  <br/>        <br/> By <b>Varun Dixit </b>",

      "bio": "<b>Early Days</b> <br/> At the institutional hub of Indian cricket, the Shivaji Park Gymkhana in Mumbai, Pravin Amre spotted a boy, not even in his teens, timing strokes against pacers twice his height off the front foot and the back foot. He nailed the cover drives and pulls with equal disdain and immediately caught the eye. This raw and evident talent was honed by the keen eye of Pravin Amre after this. <br/>  <br/> <b>The Grind of Domestic Cricket</b> <br/> Having decimated bowling attacks in his college days, Iyer found a spot in the Under-19 World Cup of 2014. After a lackluster performance on the slow-ish tracks, Iyer was sent to play for the Trent Bridge cricket team in England. With the ball coming on to the bat, Iyer took full toll and shot to the limelight, scoring 297 runs in 3 innings at a Bradman-esque average of 99. <br/>  <br/> The Trent Bridge stint gave his confidence the activation energy to go on and deliver stand-out performances in the domestic tournaments to follow. He averaged more than 50 in the Vijay Hazare trophy and Ranji Trophy that followed, scoring an incredible 809 runs at 50.56 in his maiden Ranji season. In the subsequent Ranji seasons, his volume of runs bordered on the ridiculous as he amassed 1321 runs in the 2015/16 edition including 7 fifties and 4 hundreds and an unprecedented average of 73.39.  <br/>  <br/> <b>The X-factor and rise to fame</b> <br/> His strike-rate was even more eye-catching and he immediately drew comparisons to legendary Indian batsman Virender Sehwag for his fearless and dominating stroke-play, and more specifically, his hand-eye coordination, even against abrupt lateral movement. <br/>  <br/> <b>Technique</b> <br/> Iyer’s technique is a typical stroke-player’s technique, built on picking up the line and length early and playing through the line of the ball. However, the trade-off to that technique is committing to the line of the ball early and having too many shots for the same ball. For this reason, Iyer did have a few iffy innings in the 2017/18 Ranji trophy with the ball nipping about off the seam and was beaten and dismissed on bowling-friendly surfaces to shots more suitable on true wickets. However, with age on his side, he has enough time to work on his flaws and cover up the chinks in his armor in the near future.   <br/>  <br/> <b>Rise to International cricket: what the future holds</b> <br/> After scoring a 202 off 210 balls in the practice match against Australia in the lead-up to the home series against them in early 2017, the national selectors could no longer remain oblivious to Iyer and he was selected in the Test squad to replace an injured Virat Kohli. He did not receive a Test cap, however, but was rewarded with a spot in the limited-overs XI in late 2017. His opportunities in these matches don’t offer a large enough sample space to make a judgement about his ability, but given the stats and his attacking stroke-play, he looks like he has the potential to become a future superstar in Indian cricket. <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/> Shreyas Iyer got a whopping 2.6 Crores from a base price of 10 Lakhs and attained the distinction of being the highest-earning uncapped player of the 2015 auction - the IPL lingo for the most sought-after uncapped player. Pravin Amre, the assistant coach of Delhi Daredevils at that time was responsible for bringing Iyer to Delhi. Iyer didn't let his childhood coach down. He was the talk of the town after scoring 439 runs in the tournament, earning himself the emerging player award and showcasing his aggressive style of play and knocking on the selectors’ doors for an India call-up.  <br/>  <br/> However, the 2016 season was a stark contrast for Iyer as he only made 30 runs in the six innings that he represented Delhi in. The Mumbai lad got his groove back in the 2017 season and managed to score 336 runs with the highest score of 96. But the 2018 season proved to be a breakthrough one for Iyer, he was consistent throughout the season and halfway through the campaign, he became the captain of Delhi after Gautam Gambhir dropped himself from the team. In 2019, Iyer will not only be looking to have a good season as a batsman but also as a skipper. A sensational season might just bring him back in the reckoning for the Indian team for the World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Rishi Roy and Varun Dixit</b> <br/> <i>As of 24th January 2018</i>",

      "bio": "Hailing from a remote village in Uttar Pradesh, born to a fast-bowler-turned-farmer, Mohammed Shami’s father spotted a spark in only one of his five children (all aspiring fast bowlers) and took him to a renowned coach in Moradabad, the closest city to their village. A bundle of energy, he was known to be a hard-worker full of stamina and trained like a workhorse under the watchful eye of Badruddin Siddique. <br/>  <br/> After being snubbed from the U-19 selections due to alleged politically-corrupt selections, Shami was advised to move to Kolkata by his coach. He was taken under the apprenticeship of Debabrata Das to the extent of staying under his roof and just about made it to the U-22 Bengal side. After a specially conducted net session supervised by Sourav Ganguly, Shami was recognized as a special talent and after a tough grind through the ranks, he got his chance to represent Bengal at the Ranji level. After a commendable set of performances at the domestic level, Shami was selected for the West Indies A tour in 2012, where he impressed with his pace and lateral movement on relatively flat surfaces with little or no assistance for fast bowlers. From an impressive 10-wicket haul at the grassy Eden track to the unprecedented 11-wicket haul at the rather unhelpful Indore track, Shami was fast proving to be one of the stand-out and versatile performers in the Indian domestic circuit.  <br/>  <br/> Shami slowly made his way into national reckoning and was handed an ODI debut in early 2013. Slowly but surely, he started to make significant contributions and with his ability to reverse/contrast swing the old white ball, he became an indispensable asset to the limited-overs side, becoming the second-fastest Indian to 50 ODI wickets in the process. He proved his worth in gold in the 2015 World Cup taking 17 wickets and ending up as one of the highest wicket-takers in the tournament. It was later revealed that he had played the World Cup through a knee injury. Looking a tad deeper into the performance, he was India’s most economical bowler in the tournament, except in the semi-final loss against Australia, in a period when the power-play laws were stacked for the batsmen.  <br/>  <br/> With the red cherry, Shami made his debut in the home series against the West Indies, more popularly known as Sachin Tendulkar’s farewell series. He immediately impressed with his ability to bowl the seam-up delivery and to move the ball off the seam as well as reverse-swing the SG ball in India and as a result, he took 9 wickets on debut against the West Indies. He had moderate away tours in New Zealand and South Africa, and struggled on the tour to England, where he was expected to do well with his ability to jag the ball off the deck. However, in conditions less favorable for bowling in Australia, he picked up 15 wickets in 3 Tests before falling prey to injury again.  <br/>  <br/> With his appreciable ability to move the new ball off the deck and reverse the old ball in the air, Shami has proved to be a master of ball maintenance and performance in unhelpful conditions. However, the tendency to pick up injuries at regular intervals kept him on and off the game. A setback in his personal life troubled him for a period of time but he has matured as a person and also as a cricketer over the years. On 22 June 2019, in a game against Afghanistan, Shami became the second Indian (after Chetan Sharma) in the history of 50-over World Cup to take a hat-trick. On 12 July 2022, he became the quickest Indian to take 150 ODI wickets. Due to his consistency in the last few years, he has developed into one of the premier fast bowlers for India in white-ball cricket. Very few in the world have the ability to bowl with an upright seam and keep the batters guessing to which way the ball will move. <br/>   <br/> An untimely injury to Hardik Pandya forced India to veer off their preferred path during the 2023 Cricket World Cup and Shami got his chance to impress. Despite featuring in only 7 games, Shami reaped a rich haul of 24 wickets (the most by any bowler in the tournament). It included 2 5-wicket hauls and a career-best 7-wicket haul in the semi-finals against New Zealand. The man who was only expected to play a side role at the start of the tournament had trumped everyone to climb up to the top of the ladder. He then became the joint second-fastest bowler to clinch 200 ODI wickets during the course of his 6th five-wicket haul, against Bangladesh, during India's victorious Champions Trophy march in 2025.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL - Through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> Initially part of his home franchise - Kolkata Knight Riders - Mohammed Shami got only a handful of opportunities. Post his impressive international debut, Delhi Daredevils bought him for Rs. 4.25 crore in 2014. Shami has been on the expensive side with the ball in the Indian Premier League and injuries hasn’t helped his cause either. With his IPL economy rate above 9, his 5-year association with Delhi ended as the franchise decided to release him. During the 2019 IPL auctions, Shami was roped in by Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings) for Rs 4.40 crore. Having regained his mojo in white-ball cricket, Shami’s fortunes changed since then. He performed brilliantly in the three seasons he played for them – 19 wickets (2019), 20 wickets (2020), 19 wickets (2021). Shami was drafted in by Gujarat Titans in 2022 in their debut season. He shone with the ball again, taking 20 wickets in 17 games and played a pivotal role in helping the Titans lift the IPL title in their first season. He bettered his performance in the next season (2023) with them. He won the Purple Cap for taking the highest number of wickets (28) in 17 matches in the 2023 season.",

      "bio": "It was a kind of headline that catches Indian eyes. First there was a mention of the word Tendulkar. ‘Teenage prodigy knocks over Tendulkar for a duck’. There was a whisper of a 19-year-old, who had worked out Sachin Tendulkar in the domestic circuit and bowled him out for his first ever duck in domestic first-class cricket. <br/>  <br/> Bhuvneshwar Kumar, born in Meerut, the manufacturing home of the SG ball, shot into the limelight when he debuted on Christmas Day in 2012, making the white Kookaburra zip all around the Pakistani bats at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. A demonstration of nagging swing bowling in the shortest format of the game in batting-friendly conditions was a fine way to make the world sit up and take notice of this precocious talent. <br/>  <br/> Having made the usually unresponsive white Kookaburra talk in a high-pressure game against Pakistan, and with a dearth of quality fast-bowling in the country, Bhuvneshwar was given the nod by the selectors for the Chennai Test against Australia in 2013. Bhuvneshwar was selected in the ODI squad for the Champions Trophy in 2013. He was later selected for the tri-nation tournament where he claimed career best figures of 4-8 against Sri Lanka. He was awarded the Man of the Series, having finished the series with the maximum number of wickets. <br/>  <br/> He continued to be a regular member of the side for the limited-overs format and toured South Africa and New Zealand without much success as he started to lose his craft in his quest to find pace. He did well in the Test series in England in 2014, finishing the series as the highest wicket-taker, and getting his name up in the Lord’s honours board, as the raised seam of the Dukes helped him achieve prodigious movement in the air against the famed English batting line-up. He also made relatively exceptional contributions with the bat, registering three fifties in the series.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Bhuvneshwar was expected to perform well in the 2015 World Cup. However, his poor fitness did not allow him to be part of the playing eleven. He played only one game against UAE. The 2016 season was packed with a single away tour in West Indies and was then followed by as many as 12 home Tests, it meant Bhuvneshwar was restricted to just four matches. He did leave a mark though - taking two five-wicket hauls, one each against West Indies and New Zealand. <br/>  <br/> His career, however, took a turn for the better once he worked on his fitness and started to swing the white Kookaburra at pace and by the Champions’ Trophy of 2017, he and Jasprit Bumrah were leading the Indian ODI pace attack with a new weapon in his armoury - the yorker. He had started to bowl well with the old ball, getting his yorkers right, and was no longer the new-ball specialist who would bowl most of his overs when the ball was new. Having picked up the pace as well, he started to reverse-swing the ball as well and became a headache for batsmen the world over. <br/>  <br/> In the Test fold, despite being picked for more helpful conditions, he continued to be an injury-replacement or an experimentation choice for the captain. He developed variations to keep himself ahead of the emerging competition, a scrambled seam delivery in the home series against Australia in 2017 and the ability to get the ball to jag off the seam as well as move in the air, he had expanded his repertoire enough to become an indispensable asset to the Indian Test team.  <br/>  <br/> Bhuvneshwar's new-formed potency tormented the visiting Sri Lankan side, and even having South Africa’s famed top-order at sea in their own backyard  during the 2017-18 series, but at a crucial juncture before the tour of England in mid-2018, an unfortunate injury had him sidelined from Tests; a major setback for an Indian side which was relying on his skilful and reliable swing bowling along with his newly-developed scrambled-seam variation which might have tuned out to be pivotal given the English conditions. However, it was becoming evident that Bhuvneshwar was slowing down, he did feature in India's white-ball teams, notably in the 2021 and 2022 T20 World Cups, before being left out in favour of newer pacers.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> SRH's go-to bowler at both ends of an innings. Be it picking up early wickets, or choking the opposition in death overs, Bhuvneshwar Kumar has done it all in the IPL. His baptism into the cash-rich league, wasn't quite as smooth though. After being picked as a rookie fast bowler ahead of the 2009 edition, Bhuvi didn't get any opportunities at the RCB in his first two years at the Franchise. Although he did play a lone game against Delhi Daredevils in 2009 Champions league, Bhuvi couldn't tick the wickets column and was subsequently overlooked in the shortest format. <br/>  <br/> In 2011, the then newest-franchise Pune Warriors signed him on and he was one of the shining lights in an otherwise doomed franchise which ended up as one of the least successful sides in the history of IPL. Post the dissolution of Pune Warriors, SRH signed Bhuvi in 2014 and his growth in both international and IPL cricket became almost parallel as the swing bowler continued to develop several variations to his game. He was one of the first players in IPL to use the knuckle ball to great advantage and those bundle of variations helped him clinch the Purple Cap (awarded for highest wicket-taker in the season) for two successive seasons, 2016 and 2017. While those highs could never be replicated, Bhuvneshwar continued to be a vital part of the franchise set-up until the 2025 season, where he was a big money buy from the Royal Challengers. <br/> ",

      "bio": "A dressing room full of tattooed arms, gelled hair, peroxide highlights and dabbing twenty-somethings defines the post-Tendulkar era of Indian cricket. Amidst all the glitter and spunk of the youthful Indian dressing room, a quiet young man of short stature was the unlikely outcast. <br/>  <br/> From the Dombivli suburb of Mumbai, Ajinkya Rahane was born to middle-class parents, who fully supported his passion for cricket. Due to lack of resources, Rahane had his initiation on a matted wicket in Dombivli, and started to to train with Pravin Amre at the age of 17. Rahane, the squeaky clean kid, took to cricket as if it were a religion and rose through the ranks of junior cricket and into the Ranji fold. In Ranji Trophy too, he excelled and, plundering 1089 runs in his second season and started to knock on the selectors' doors. However, the great Indian batting order had no space for the young cricketer, and Rahane continued to cruise through Ranji seasons, rupturing old records and churning out centuries day in and day out.  <br/>  <br/> Rahane's came out on top in his first encounter with international bowlers, easing his way to a 172 in a Duleep Trophy encounter against the likes of England internationals like Liam Plunkett and Graham Onions. Rahane then delivered a critical performance of undeniable prowess when he hammered two hundreds in the emerging players' tournament in Australia, proving his worth in adverse conditions, and reminded observers of the game of another teen-aged <i>Mumbaikar</i>, with a similarly punchy technique, who had taken a special liking to Australian pitches in 1992... <br/>  <br/> After his peerless performance in Australia, he was well and truly in the national reckoning. It couldn't have been timed better; in August 2011, the Indian limited overs side found itself in desperate circumstances after conceding the Test series 0-4 in England. With several players undergoing lack of form and ailing from injuries, Rahane was flown in for the T20Is against England. He responded immediately as a stand-in opener with a fluent 61 on T20I debut and 40 on ODI debut, showing that adaptability was definitely a virtue that he could be entrusted with. A compact technique was the call of the hour and he definitely had the skills to encounter the late movement, as opposed to several of his technically-inferior compatriots. However, he soon started a bench-warming spree that would last a few months after the regulars returned for the home season. <br/>  <br/> Following the retirement of stalwarts like VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid, the Indian selectors started the process of blooding the youngsters for the big stage. After a year in and out of the team, and 16 months on the bench, an injury to Shikhar Dhawan finally got Rahane the most desirable piece of attire in Indian cricket – Test cap number 278. <br/>  <br/> After a poor outing on Test debut, Rahane marked the beginning becoming India's most versatile and most needed player - their saviour in foreign conditions. On Boxing Day 2013, walked into Kingsmead at 199-4. Amidst a late-order collapse, he batted with the tail to end up on 51*, having countered a fiery Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander on a tricky surface to stretch the first-innings total to 334. In the second innings, with India reeling at 71-4, still trailing by 95 runs, Rahane scored a fluent 96 in a lone effort to rescue his team and emancipate them from their drought of away victories. He ensured that South Africa batted again, but only managed to stretch the lead to 58. India went on to lose the match, and the series, but they had unearthed a gem of an overseas player. <br/>  <br/> His technical nous, balance at the crease, and his compact technique were exemplary as he effortlessly checked his drives and played late without the wristy bottom-hand drive - a virtue lacking in most subcontinental batsmen of the generation. He had a pronounced forward movement and a front-on stance which was instrumental in making him a good short ball player - another skill most of his compatriots lacked.  <br/>  <br/> Rahane went on to become India's most accomplished batsman overseas (along with Murali Vijay) throughout India's away season in 2013/14. After missing out in Durban, he scored his maiden hundred in Wellington on the tour to New Zealand on a seaming surface. On a garden of a seaming track in Lord's, he paved the way for India's first Lord's victory in 28 years (and their first major overseas win since Perth 2008) with a composed 103, getting himself on the honours board in the process. Later in the series, he continued to look the most technically-skilled batsman amongst his teammates - the rock that survived the English storm in the last three Tests. He ended the year with a magnificent 147 on a bouncy MCG strip during the Boxing Day Test against Australia, stitching together a  262-run partnership with Virat Kohli. This, on the back of an 81 on a seaming track at the Gabba, reinforced his reputation as the rock in the Indian middle-order.  <br/>  <br/> After his hundred at Kingston in August 2016, Rahane now had a hundred in every Test-playing nation he had played in, except South Africa where he had a 96, and Bangladesh where he had a 98. However, despite being having an unrivaled away record relative to his peers, Rahane had a surprisingly poor record at home. He put all the naysayers to rest by stroking his way to two hundreds in the Delhi Test against South Africa in 2015, wrapping up a dominating win in the series against the Proteas. <br/>  <br/> Despite being a vital cog in the Test line-up, Rahane continued to go in and out of the ODI side. He did, however, do well enough to be given a ticket to the 2015 World Cup in Australia, where he performed admirably in the middle-order, playing a vital knock of 79 against South Africa in India's maiden World Cup win against them. However, he was dropped from the side on account of having a high dot-ball percentage late in 2015, and since then became a Test specialist for India. He did continue to get chances in ODIs as an injury-replacement, and grabbed them with both hands. He was the highest run-getter in the ODIs in the West Indies in mid-2017; however, with the return of Rohit Sharma, Rahane was out of the ODI side again, owing to the lack of spots in the side and the established opening pair for Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma.  <br/>  <br/> Rahane saw a bit of a dip in form during the Ranji Trophy season of 2017/18, as Mumbai uncharacteristically failed to get past the quarter-final stages, scoring his first duck in Ranji cricket since 2008. His run of poor form lasted alarmingly long as he failed to make any significant contribution in the home series against a scarcely competent Sri Lankan bowling line-up. After a barren run which saw him go 15 Tests without a ton, Rahane was dropped from the Indian team after the away series in South Africa in 2022.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> In the initial years, Ajinkya Rahane played for his native franchise, the Mumbai Indians. As he was a rookie uncapped player at that point, not many opportunities arrived and it was not until his shift to Rajasthan Royals that Rahane started to show consistency in the IPL. A steady opener who can find the gaps in the Powerplay and consolidate thereafter, he became one of the vital cogs around which the Royals batting revolved. The 2012 season was his breakthrough year in the tournament, amassing over 550 runs at a healthy strike rate, including his maiden IPL century. In fact, the years 2012-16 saw Rahane cementing his position as one of the most consistent performers in the tournament’s history. <br/>  <br/> The 2017 season saw him struggle throughout the tournament, resulting in his worst-ever tally since 2014 as a senior cricketer. The story was pretty similar in 2018 too, with the burden of captaincy further proving difficult for Rahane to handle. He opened the innings for a major part of the tournament but with his form a concern, he even shifted to number three to allow the more aggressive Rahul Tripathi to partner Jos Buttler at the top. As time went by, Rahane's IPL career too came towards a grinding halt, but being a champion player, he resurrected his batting style during the 2023 tournament after being a surprise pick by the Chennai Super Kings.  <br/>  <br/> 326 runs wasn't too many, but he refreshingly scored them at a healthy strike-rate of 172.48 and his knocks were a pillar of support as the Super Kings rode on to clinch their 5th IPL title. It however proved to be a false dawn as a below average performance in the following season saw him getting left out of the squad ahead of the 2025 auctions. For anyone else, that could have been the end of the road, but not for Rahane. He picked the pieces and led marvellously to help Mumbai clinch the Syed Mustaq Ali trophy for the 2024-25 season. Rahane led from the front and top-scored for the team with 469 runs, his performances underlining the fact that he still had a lot of cricket left in him. This show convinced the Kolkata Knight Riders to take a punt on him during the 2025 auctions and they topped it up further by naming him as the captain for the 2025 season.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ",

      "bio": "There was a whisper in the cricketing fraternity in the early 2000s – a boy from Saurashtra had just scored a triple-hundred at the Under-14 level. Then there were sightings: the same boy scored a double-hundred against England at the Under-19 level. The whispers got more prominent as he began to torment bowling attacks on his placid home-ground in Rajkot, and almost forced officials to change the playing conditions, such was his run-making prowess at the Ranji level.  <br/>  <br/> It was only a few years down the line that we came across small newspaper segments about the same boy with a squarer jawline and denser facial hair going by the name of <b>Cheteshwar Pujara</b>, scoring double-hundreds for breakfast and triple-hundreds for dinner at the Ranji level. After several years of being scoffed at for making runs on a flat Rajkot wicket, Cheteshwar Pujara started to seep into the minds of the selectors. In the minds of the India public, we had already found the natural successor to Rahul Dravid.  <br/>  <br/> Armed with an atavistic batting methodology and mindset, Pujara brings the best of both worlds to the table. His focus on the longer format is a much-needed change in the current set-up of world cricket, where instant glory and quick money in franchise-based leagues is slowly taking over from an era when Ranji trophy performance was paramount. His comparison to Rahul Dravid, however, is more to do with his dogged mindset than his technique. <br/>  <br/> A phlegmatic and determined batsman, his technique is surprisingly bottom-handed, dependent on running his wrists through the ball, rather than punching it with his fore-arms. However, because of his straight-batted technique (coming down from first slip rather than gully), and his relatively young hands, he has managed to make it work by playing late and very close to his body.  <br/>  <br/> Cheteshwar Pujara got his inevitable national call-up in the home series against Australia in 2010. After an unplayable grubber pinned him LBW in the first innings, he walked out to bat in the number 3 position in the second-innings, instead of his 'predecessor' Rahul Dravid, and made a fluent 72 on a tricky 4th innings run-chase on a dry and turning wicket in Bangalore, becoming the fifth Indian to score a 4th innings half-century on debut. Pujara was subsequently picked for the South Africa tour of 2010/11 and played in the 2nd and 3rd Tests. He didn't make any significant contributions, but made it clear that he had the grit to stay out there with the senior batsmen. He showed improvement while playing in the second of his two Tests, standing up tall to play Morkel and opening up his stance. However, a knee injury during the 2011 IPL ruled him out of contention for the Australia and England tours later that year.  <br/>  <br/> He made a full recovery and made a comeback in the home season that followed. He wasted no time and accumulated a fluent 206* against England in the Ahmedabad Test and followed it up with a 135 in the Mumbai Test, fighting a lone battle while the other batsmen made playing spin seem like an alien skill. Pujara had finally gained momentum in Test cricket - a format he seemed destined for.  <br/>  <br/> He continued to milk any bowling attack at home, continuing his penchant for 'Daddy hundreds' with a 204 against Australia in Hyderabad, and made a remarkable 4th innings 82* while opening in the Delhi Test to close out a run-chase. He seemed to be batting on a different wicket as his partners failed around him, as he helped India return the favour and seal a 4-0 whitewash against Australia at home. <br/>  <br/> Pujara's feats on his home turf were indisputable, but he did not have the weight of 'away' runs behind him to be termed a 'versatile' cricketer. He silenced all the cynics by showing dogged resistance on a seaming track and then going onto score a 153 in the first Test at the Wanderers against South Africa. The gritty batsman followed it up with a fifty in the succeeding Durban Test, against a supreme attack consisting of Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander, confirming that he was no one-Test wonder. He couldn't replicate his score on the tour to New Zealand in 2014, but continued to show unerring grit and focus against some quality fast bowling, and continuing to do his job of blunting out the new ball.  <br/>  <br/> With the rather large shoes of Rahul Dravid to fill, a poor run of form in England and Australia in 2014 saw Pujara lose favour with the selectors and he controversially lost his place in the Test side. He didn't look technically inept; in fact, he did the difficult part of the job by playing out the new ball and the seaming ball, paving the way for the middle-order to score – case in point, Ajinkya Rahane's memorable 103 at Lord's, thanks to a not-so-memorable 117-ball 28 by Pujara to play out the first session on a minefield of a track. Nonetheless, modern cricket is a game of numbers, and as a result, Pujara was subsequently dropped. <br/>  <br/> He continued to work on his game, however, and remained in the reckoning for a national comeback. He made the most of an injury set-back to Murali Vijay in the 2015 series in Sri Lanka, reminding the selectors of his mettle by carrying his bat through his epic unbeaten 145 on an uncharacteristically seaming wicket at the SSC, Colombo, paving the way for an Indian win in the decider. Pujara has raised the bar even further since then, hammering routine hundreds during India's long home season and the odd series in Sri Lanka and West Indies.  <br/>  <br/> He has showcased his versatility in the limited overs formats too, scoring 346 runs at a stunning average of 116 in the 2006 Under-19 World Cup, ending up as the highest run-getter. He signed a contract with the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League in 2008, and moved to Royal Challengers Bangalore for the 2011 season. However, due to lack of performances against the white ball and his reputation as an exclusive Test player, he was never given an extended run in the Indian ODI fold. Nevertheless, given the densely-packed cricket calendar, Pujara took Robert Frost's 'road less traveled' and continued to focus on his forte – Test cricket, even having a stint in the county circuit to improve his technique against the Dukes ball in England's distinctive seaming conditions.  <br/>  <br/> Pujara is one of the modern rebels, in that he is a cricketing purist. His technique isn't the prettiest. The charm of his batting lies in the nostalgia of the years gone by: The survival instinct off a home-made technique containing all the essentials of batting, done his own way under the watchful eye of his father Arvind Pujara. Despite all the ridicule against the gigantic hundreds on Rajkot belters, the Pujaras persevered and reaped their rewards. At a higher level, when Pujara was dropped for the Gros Islet Test in 2016 for having a low strike-rate, Virat Kohli's exposure and struggle against the new ball raised a much-needed alarm and reminded the dressing room about the importance of Cheteshwar Pujara. He went on to score 1140 runs in the 2017 calendar year, having played 2 innings less than Steven Smith who finished top of the table.  <br/>  <br/> All the scoffing naysayers have seen the truth: Cheteshwar Pujara is built on cricketing merit; spending more time in the nets than in the gym, focusing on a tailor-made cricket body rather than a beach body. With a lengthy away season coming up, Pujara will be a key player if India are to achieve success in overseas conditions, as he continues to do the thankless job of guarding the middle-order against the new ball. With a more mature head on his shoulders and a tweaked technique, it would come as a surprise to no one if he scored runs by the barrel. <br/>  <br/> A humble man, Pujara himself summed up his role in the side: <i>'When you're playing Test cricket for your country, you can't just play your natural game. You play the circumstances.'</i> That, right there, is Cheteshwar Pujara for you in a nutshell – <i>Team first, self later.</i> <br/>  <br/> By <b>Rishi Roy</b> <br/> <i>As of 2nd January 2018</i>",

      "bio": "Hailed as the next big thing in Indian cricket, Ishant Sharma shot into the limelight by bowling a dream spell to Ricky Ponting in the Perth Test when India toured Australia in 2008. Ishant, who hails from Delhi, is nicknamed Lambu (meaning Tall Guy), which is in reference to his lean and tall build. Measuring 193cm, Ishant started playing serious cricket at the age of 14 and soon made his Ranji Trophy debut for Delhi at the age of 18. He was first selected for India in May 2007 when India toured Bangladesh and made his Test debut in that same series. His big break came when he prised out the Pakistani side on a flat Chinnaswamy deck en route to taking 5/140 in December 2007. That bowling effort won him a place on India's tour to Australia and from then on there was no looking back for the lanky lad.  <br/>  <br/> Ishant, has a lovely high-arm action and is able to bowl close to the 140 kph mark consistently, which troubled the Aussies no end in that 2008 tour. The Aussie captain Ponting was Ishant's bunny as he dismissed him six times in seven Test matches. Ishant also had the distinction of having delivered the fastest ball ever bowled by an Indian, when he clocked 152.6 km/h (94.8mph) at Adelaide Oval against Australia on February 17, 2008. In the process, he also became the first Indian to bowl over 150 km/h, beating teammate Ashish Nehra's 149.7 kph delivery.  <br/>  <br/> After all the exploits in the ensuing CB series, which finished with Ishant ending up as the highest wicket-taker in the tournament with 14 wickets to his name, Ishant had well and truly arrived on the international scene. Often compared to Javagal Srinath for a similarly lean build and high-arm action, Ishant, continued to shine and during the inaugural auction of the IPL, he was picked up for a whopping $950,000 by Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan for his franchise Kolkata - making him one of the highest paid players - and instantly catapulting him into the big league at the tender age of 20.  <br/>  <br/> When the Australians came to India to play a four-match Test series later that year, Ishant along with Zaheer Khan mastered the art of reverse-swing and used it expertly to leave them dumbstruck. He gained appreciable movement both off the seam and in the air as he further enhanced his reputation with some fine spells of fast bowling on some placid wickets. He was named Man of the Series for his 15 wickets as he helped India to a 2-0 series victory.  <br/>  <br/> The year 2009 turned out to be a rough one for the Delhi lad as he got to experience the vagaries of international cricket. It all started to go wrong during the second edition of the IPL when he looked a pale shadow of the bowler he is as he was smashed to all corners of the ground. With his performance plummeting, his side, Kolkata, had a horrid season finishing last. The downward slide continued in the T20 World Cup as well and the wheel came full circle when he was dropped from the side mid-way during the India - Australia ODI series in October 2009 after another disappointing show with the ball.  <br/>  <br/> In 2012, Ishant underwent an ankle surgery and was out of action for the months that followed. After a string of poor performances, the selectors started to view Ishant as a Test specialist. However, his performances in Tests never got any better and he was very poor in the Tests in England and Australia, and again when Australia toured India, where he picked only 16 wickets from eight Tests.  <br/>  <br/> Ishant did not have a good year in 2013. After performing listlessly in Tests, he was thrashed in the IPL. Against Chennai, playing for Hyderabad, he conceded 66 runs in his spell of four overs - the most runs for any bowler in IPL history at that time. When Australia toured India in October/November 2013, Ishant equaled the record for the most expensive over by an Indian bowler, conceding 30 runs in the third ODI. He was, hence, dropped from both the Test and ODI squads for the West Indies tour that followed. However, Ishant was named in both the teams for the South Africa tour in December 2013.  <br/>  <br/> Since his return to the Test squad, however, Ishant performed very well. In the ODI format though, he was expensive in New Zealand and was again left out of the side for the 2014 Asia Cup. In the IPL auctions for the 2014 edition, Ishant was bought back by the Hyderabad franchise, for whom he played in 2013.  <br/>  <br/> Ishant played three Test matches on the tour to England in 2014, where he bagged the Man of the Match award with a match-winning performance in the second innings of the Lord's Test, with figures of 7/74. His personal-best performance helped MS Dhoni bag a rare overseas Test victory as India made history at the Home of Cricket. Ishant did not feature in the ODI series that followed and was not preferred for the West Indies series as well. However, he returned to ODI cricket with a bang, bagging career-best figures of 4/34 against Sri Lanka in the third ODI at Cuttack. Ishant spearheaded the Indian attack in the 2014-15 Border-Gavaskar Trophy in three Test matches, before being sidelined for the final Test with an injury. Keeping in mind his height and the ability to generate extra bounce, the selectors named him in the squad for the 2015 World Cup. However, as Ishant failed to recover from a knee injury, he was ruled out of the showpiece event. Mohit Sharma replaced Ishant in the squad. <br/>  <br/> The Sri Lankan tour in 2015 was a big tipping point, especially his eight wickets in the deciding Test in Colombo - which swung the match India's way. His returns at home weren't as expected, then an injury and a marriage-enforced break meant he ended up missing most of the home season in 2016. <br/>  <br/> Since 2016, Ishant clearly stepped down in the pecking order of Indian fast bowlers. The return to fitness of Mohammed Shami and the resurgence of Umesh Yadav left the lanky Delhi pacer warming the benches for most of the season. Ishant did get to show his wares in a few Tests during the long 13-Test Indian home season in 2016-17, but on pitches that were unresponsive for his style of bowling, he barely managed decent figures. In the years that followed, Ishant managed to hold on to his place in the Indian Test team. In India’s 2018 tour to England, Ishant claimed his 250th Test wicket in the fourth game. In February of 2021, Ishant joined an elite list of players after playing his 100th Test. He had a sober outing in a game that India’s spinners dominated. Thereafter, however, the rise of young pacers like Mohammad Siraj coupled with a change of leadership prompted by Virat Kohli’s resignation as Test captain, led to Ishant’s exit from the Test team.

      "bio": "'I always wanted to be a bit different,' Suryakumar says of his thirst for innovation in batting. Be it his signature pick-up flick over fine-leg or his stupendous ability to carve yorkers over the ropes, Suryakumar Yadav, or SKY as he’s better known, defies convention, makes jaws drop and outrages bowlers nearly every time he walks out. Despite being a relatively late entrant into India’s T20 setup, Suryakumar Yadav quickly established himself as one of the vital cogs once he got his opportunity.  <br/>  <br/> Training under the guidance of his paternal uncle and then at the Elf Vengsarkar Academy, Suryakumar Yadav worked his way through the Mumbai cricketing circuit and made his first-class debut against Delhi during the 2010-11 Ranji season. He had a great start to his career as he top-scored for Mumbai with a well compiled 73 and was the only player to score a fifty in Mumbai's first innings. He had a breakthrough Ranji Trophy season in 2011-12 where he was the top-scorer for Mumbai with 754 runs in 9 games and later in the year, he was the recipient of the MA Chidambaram Trophy awarded to the Best Under-22 cricketer.  <br/>  <br/> Impressed by his talent, he received an IPL contract from Mumbai Indians in 2011, for whom he played a few IPL matches until 2013, before getting picked up by Kolkata Knight Riders. It was for the Kolkata-based franchise that his ability to improvise gained some popularity. The knack of playing useful cameos lower down the order came in handy, and he featured in every single game of the Knight Riders' title-winning campaign in 2014. But after a few seasons there, where although he made useful contributions, the opportunities to really make an impression were few and far between, he was re-signed by MI again - a move that proved to be a revelation. <br/>  <br/> Picked to open the batting for IPL 2018, Suryakumar finished as the highest run-getter in the tournament for Mumbai with a remarkable tally of 512 runs (Avg. 36.57, S/R 133.33). His remarkable consistency was one of the few bright spots in an otherwise disappointing campaign for the franchise. However, that season was but a sign of what was to follow. SKY continued to amass the runs and capture the imagination through the following seasons. Scoring 424 and 480 runs in 2019 and 2020, SKY was instrumental in Mumbai’s back-to-back title triumphs and calls for his inclusion into India’s national setup started to grow louder.  <br/>  <br/> SKY’s T20I debut finally came in March of 2021 in a home series against England and staying true to his reputation, he hit the first ball he faced for six en-route to a maiden fifty. The 2021 T20 World Cup was underwhelming for both India and SKY but come 2022, everything was about to change. His performances that year were nothing short of a dream. After cracking a maiden T20I century against England at Trent Bridge, he added two more to the tally - one in New Zealand and another against Sri Lanka at Rajkot. He was also the 3rd highest run-scorer at the 2022 T20 World Cup and his antics earned him the ICC Men’s T20I Cricketer of the Year award for 2022.  <br/>  <br/> Suryakumar Yadav continued to dominate the IPL in 2023 as well where he scored 605 runs in 16 games and was the leading run-scorer for the Mumbai Indians. By now firmly established in India’s limited overs setup, he was a part of India’s squad for the 2023 Cricket World Cup. The disappointment after India lost in the final was palpable and SKY’s own performances with bat did little to mitigate it.  <br/>  <br/> Despite all his antics with bat, Suryakumar Yadav will probably be best remembered for taking the catch that effectively won India the 2024 T20 World Cup. In a tight final with South Africa marginally ahead, SKY took a superb catch on the long-off boundary to dismiss David Miller in the final over. While the country was rife in celebration post India’s triumph, SKY had a little personal achievement to celebrate too as he was named India’s T20I captain following Rohit Sharma’s retirement from the format.   <br/>  <br/> Since taking over as T20I captain, Suryakumar Yadav has led India to series wins away to Sri Lanka and South Africa, while also thumping England at home. He has helped usher in a new wave of young, fearless cricketers with the likes of Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma and others thriving under his leadership. However, SKY’s personal form hasn’t reached the lofty heights it once had since taking over captaincy responsibilities.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Anurag Hegde</b>",

      "bio": "Born in Haryana, Yuzvendra Chahal is a fine right-arm leg-spinner, who made his first-class debut at the age of 19 in an away game against Madhya Pradesh at Indore. Though he has not played many first-class games, he has been impressive in the shortest format and it also earned him an IPL contract with Mumbai Indians in 2011.  <br/>  <br/> However, the Mumbai franchise did not give him many matches and he went into the auction pool for the 2014 edition of the IPL. It indeed was a blessing in disguise for the leggie as he was picked up the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), for whom he played an integral part in their bowling set up.  <br/>  <br/> For the first time in his IPL career, Chahal played all the matches in a season and was one of Virat Kohli's go-to man in crunch situations. He started off the season very well in the UAE, but once the tournament returned to India, he couldn't get many wickets. However, he was economical throughout the season. He was also a contender for the Emerging Player of the Year award but he lost out to Axar Patel in the end.  <br/>  <br/> Chahal has since then grown onto become the linchpin of Royal Challengers Bangalore's spin attack. While he doesn't have a deceptive googly, he more than makes up for it with his skiddy bowling action and accurate line and length. One of the few bowlers who doesn't mind to lure the batsmen with the flight, several of his wickets have come with the batsmen attempting to clear the fence. <br/>  <br/> His success in the shorter format of the game and Virat Kohli's first hand knowledge resulted in his inclusion in the Indian team - first for the Twenty20 format of the game and then the 50-over game. The tour to Zimbabwe in mid-2016 was the ideal opportunity to infuse fresh blood and Chahal took his chances with both hands, impressing in both forms of the game. <br/>  <br/> Having shone in his first chance, Chahal took his game a step further when England came visiting during the winter of 2016-17. His figures of six for 25 in the Twenty20 international are the second best ever figures for a bowler in a T20I match. Aptly, it came at his second home, M Chinnaswamy stadium. A solid series against Sri Lanka followed and Chahal has put himself in the queue if the selectors deem that a wrist spinner would be ideal in the scheme of things as India prepare for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> He started his spell with RCB by playing all 14 league games. Though he finished with only 12 wickets, Chahal was nominated for the Emerging Player of the Year, which he lost to Axar Patel. The following two season saw Chahal grow as a player - picking up 44 wickets and becoming one of RCB's vital cogs. In the 2018 edition, he went past Vinay Kumar to become the leading wicket-taker for the Bangalore franchise.  <br/>  <br/> Though RCB retained only Kohli and AB de Villiers before the 2018 auction, Chahal was bought back by the Bangalore team via the RTM (right to match) for INR 6 crore. <br/>  <br/> by <b>Cricbuzz Staff</b>",

      "bio": "A dewy-eyed aspiring left-arm fast bowler with a build ill-suited for the job joined an academy in Kanpur with big dreams of becoming the next Zaheer Khan for India. After a considerable period of time, Kuldeep and his coach Kapil Pandey realised that his talents did not align with the task. Consequently, he was advised to take Robert Frost’s 'road less travelled’ - slow left-arm <i>unorthodox</i>, or wrist-spin. <br/>  <br/> Kuldeep, a rare breed of left-arm wrist-spin bowlers in the modern day, had revived the art out of its grave along with a handful of other young players. He set the 2014 Under-19 World Cup alight by becoming India's leading wicket-taker in the tournament, adding the distinction of becoming the first Indian bowler to take a hat-trick in the history of the tournament, considered to be a watershed for the Indian youth and started to attract the eye of the selectors. With regard to his potential, Kuldeep was given more exposure in the 2016 Duleep Trophy and he once again bamboozled the clueless batsmen. The young spinner ended the tournament with 17 wickets in three matches and played a major role in leading his side to the final of the tournament - a commendable feat for an alleged rookie. <br/>  <br/> Despite getting limited opportunities, Kuldeep’s traditional guile and equally unconventional style was now gaining recognition at the national level and he had delivered enough performances of substance to get a call-up to the Indian squad for the home Tests against Australia in 2017. He was handed the coveted Test cap by wrist spin wizard Anil Kumble in Dharamsala. Replacing an injured Virat Kohli, the young man comprehensively foxed the experienced Australian batsmen, who were clearly caught by surprise by the selection. Yadav finished with four wickets on debut, laying the platform for a decisive Indian win as the Border-Gavaskar trophy returned to India. <br/>  <br/> Yadav didn’t have to wait too long for his ODI call-up, making his first pyjama appearance during the tour of West Indies in mid-2017. He was the joint highest wicket-taker on this tour, and was shockingly overlooked for the first three ODIs in Sri Lanka. He made a return in the final two matches and the subsequent Australia series, in which he made a statement (albeit metaphorically) that dropping him was a mistake, with a hat-trick against the Aussies; the first for India in ODIs since Kapil Dev and Chetan Sharma, more than 2 decades previously. His Test debut came just a year later in 2018 and he picked up a fifer on debut against the West Indies.  <br/>  <br/> Although not the world’s fittest athlete, Kuldeep evolved as a bowler and learnt the tricks of the trade to exhibit his application extremely well, especially in the ODI leg of the tour of South Africa in early 2018, where he used his stock ball to good effect to run through one of the best limited-overs batting line-ups in the world, and also used his enigmatic googly sparingly such that even the most accomplished batsmen failed to pick his wrong’un from the hand. With the ability to deceive the batsmen in the air and above the eye level and the cunning ability to use the width of the crease, Kuldeep displayed all the elements required to lead a potential left-arm wrist-spin revolution having resurrected a dying art; much like his blonde, scheming right-handed counterpart gave a new lease of life to his art in the early nineties. <br/>  <br/> He performed consistently in limited-overs cricket and paired with fellow wrist-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, the duo were a force to reckon with. Their attacking wrist-spin added a new dimension to India’s fabled spin attack and the iconic ‘Kulcha’ phrase was born. Their continued ransacking of opposing batting line-ups were so impressive that they managed to keep the senior spin-duo of Ashwin and Jadeja out of the limited-overs side between 2018 and 2020. Kuldeep also found himself in India’s squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Things, however, took a turn for the worse thereafter. With wrist-spin being the rage around the world at the time, batters started playing against them more and more and Kuldeep’s aura of mystery had seemingly been unveiled. He struggled to pick wickets and returned expensive figures and India’s outlook towards their spinners changed. Instead of being paired with Chahal, Kuldeep found himself competing with his now former bowling partner as India reverted to preferring at least one finger-spinner. He was criticised for his lack of pace and for being one-dimensional. It didn’t help that he suffered a series of injuries, including a knee injury that required surgery and that kept him out of the Indian team for a prolonged period.  <br/>  <br/> However, Kuldeep returned strong. Fit and ready, he was ready to prove all those who had written him off wrong. He made his Test comeback in an away Test series against Bangladesh in 2022 and picked up 8 wickets in what was a Player of the Match worthy performance. Strangely though, he was dropped for the following game as the team looked to put out a different team-combination. He didn’t let that deter him as he made the most of the few opportunities he got. In South Africa’s tour to India in October 2022, Yadav was the wrecker-in-chief when he claimed figures of 4-18 to restrict South Africa to just 99 in the 3rd ODI. While still not cementing his spot as a regular like he did previously, Kuldeep ensured that he was always in the reckoning in all three formats when India were looking for a unique spin-option.   <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years </b> <br/>  <br/> Yadav was handed an Indian Premier League contract in 2012 by the Mumbai Indians, but he failed to make the playing XI in his debut season, despite making headlines for beating Sachin Tendulkar with his googly in the nets. He was transferred to the Kolkata Knight Riders two years later, but still failed to play a game. <br/>  <br/> In IPL 2016, Kuldeep was given his due by the KKR franchise and he didn't disappoint. The slow-left arm bowler picked up 6 wickets from 3 games. But the presence of Brad Hogg limited his chances. Having been retained for 40 lakhs ahead of the 2017 IPL, KKR decided to invest more in their potent weapon. And Kuldeep shone as well, picking up 12 wickets from 12 games. Year 2018 saw him making rapid strides at the international level and IPL also saw him creating ripples. He got his first Man of the Match award in an IPL game in the same edition as well. Against RR, Kuldeep bowled a bamboozling spell of 4 for 20 to script a fine win for KKR.  <br/>  <br/> His dip in performance at the international level, however, was expounded at the IPL. He saw poor returns in the 2019 season after he picked up only 4 wickets from 9 games at an economy rate of 8.66 and his performance in 2020 was by far his worst. Failing to make an impact, Kuldeep found himself dropped from KKR’s playing XI after picking up just 1 wicket from 4 games. He was benched in the first half of the 2021 season and was ruled out of the rest due to a knee injury. He made a roaring return to form, however, when he was picked up by the Delhi Capitals in 2022. It was his performance at this IPL, 21 wickets from just 14 games, that put him back on the map after spending a couple of years in relative oblivion. He was retained by the Capitals for the 2023 edition of the tournament.      <br/>  <br/> by <b>Rishi Roy</b> and <b>Anurag Hegde</b> <br/> ",

      "bio": "Shubman Gill is the latest prodigy of India's familial batting production line. He shot to fame with 418 runs at an average of 104.50 in the 2018 ICC U19 World Cup, where he served as Prithvi Shaw's deputy and batted at No. 3 to play a crucial role in India's record fourth world title. Also the edition's Player of the Tournament, Gill was a favourite in the 2018 IPL auctions and was picked by Kolkata Knight Riders for INR 1.8 crore (USD 280,000). <br/>  <br/> Born in Fazilka, Punjab, Gill's precocious talents found an early fan in his father, Lakhwinder Singh, who shifted base to Mohali and rented a place near the PCA Stadium so that his son could grow up with better access to cricket. And it wasn't long until Gill started grabbing headlines. He scored 351 in Punjab's Inter-District U16 tournament in 2014, racking up an opening stand of 587 with Nirmal Singh, and then went on to strike a double hundred in his U16 debut for Punjab at the 2016 Vijay Merchant Trophy.  <br/>  <br/> Gill made his List A debut for Punjab in the 2016-17 Vijay Hazare Trophy, batting one-down, and went on to make his first-class debut in the 2017-18 Ranji Trophy against Bengal, where he batted as an opener to score his maiden half-century and stepped it up in just the next game with a maiden hundred against Services. <br/>  <br/> Gill won the BCCI award for the Best Junior Cricketer for consecutive years in 2013-14 and 2014-15, knocking hard on the doors of the U19 team. When picked, Gill starred in India's handsome 3-1 win at home over England in the Youth ODIs, scoring 351 runs in 4 innings and then went on to match up to his high standards in his first tour of England soon after. India whitewashed the hosts 5-0 and Gill top-scored again with 278 runs across 4 innings.  <br/>  <br/> Gill easily looked the best batsman among his colleagues at the World Cup, comfortably overhauling even Prithvi Shaw, the 18-year-old Mumbai batsman who had the media houses buzzing with a whooping five first-class hundreds to his name. Gill's bottom-handed technique, made fashionably successful by Virat Kohli among many others, allowed him to play in a similar mould. He scored runs briskly, mixing quick singles and doubles with powerful hits across the ground, and stood out as much for his batting acumen as he did for his fielding prowess. <br/>  <br/> Once back from the World Cup in New Zealand, Gill soon found himself returning to the unglamorous grind, representing Punjab in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. He started the tournament with modest scores of 25, 4 and 8 but soon recovered, flaying a match-winning 123 against a rampant Karnataka side. <br/>  <br/> Strong showings in the 2018-19 domestic season meant that Gill was seamlessly transitioning into being a senior India player. He even looked unnerved on the big stage of the IPL, despite batting out of position for the Kolkata Knight Riders. 2019 has turned out to be a potential career-turning year for the <br/> Punjab youngster who first got picked for the ODIs in New Zealand where he also made his international debut. <br/>  <br/> With India facing the eternal number-four issue, many felt Gill would be punted with the World Cup not far away but after a handful of games (that too on extremely tough surfaces), he found himself out of the squad. Of course, the selectors and he himself knew that age is on his side and that his time would come. In the 2019 IPL, he batted in the top order and on expected lines, managed to create a bigger impact. However, it’s his exploits in red-ball cricket that’s convinced people of his completeness as a batsman. By churning out runs for fun in his brief First-class career thus far, Gill has now staked a claim for a spot across formats and has rightly been picked as a back-up opener for the home Tests against South Africa <br/>  <br/> Chances were limited in the beginning, but Gill was pushed into the deep end when he was asked to open the batting Down Under with Cummins, Starc and Hazlewood breathing down his neck. Gill gave a good account of himself, scoring a vital 91 in that famous Gabba Test which India won to claim the series 2-1 despite missing plenty of their first team regulars.  <br/>  <br/> He was soon reintegrated into the red ball team, with a spot opening up for him at the top of the order as age caught up to Shikhar Dhawan. He scored his first ODI hundred in August, 2022 against Zimbabwe and later that year notched up his first Test ton in an away series against Bangladesh.  <br/>  <br/> 2023 proved to be Shubman Gill’s year, as he swapped hats from being a prodigious talent to becoming the man of the moment. He made his T20I debut early in January, and later in that month itself scored his first century in the format, becoming the fifth Indian to have recorded centuries in all formats. Gill was scoring runs for fun in the first half of the year, and had a glorious IPL as well. He was the leading run scorer for the 2023 season, with a whopping 890 runs which included 3 centuries.  <br/>  <br/> Many expected Gill to carry that momentum into the World Cup, but his form tapered off slightly as Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer took center stage for India in that tournament. Nevertheless, Gill scored an impressive 354 runs in the World Cup with four fifties to his name. Post the World Cup, Gill has struggled to match up to his incredibly high standards, having a mediocre series away to South Africa.  <br/>  <br/> Gill was impressive in the home Tests against England in 2024, where he scored two fifties and two centuries. He followed that up with a mediocre IPL where he could manage just two fifties and a century, averaging 38.73 which was paltry compared to his lofty standards. Gill failed to make the cut for the T20 World Cup, travelling only as a reserve player. He got a chance to captain India shortly after the World Cup success, when they travelled to Zimbabwe while most of the senior players were rested. <br/>  <br/> However, Gill would see a slight dip in form starting with the home series against New Zealand in late 2024 and endured a torrid run in the Border-Gavaskar series that followed. Missing the first Test Down Under through injury, Gill failed to impress in the next two Tests and found himself out of the side for the fourth. He returned to the XI in the fifth Test at Sydney but scores of 20 and 13 meant that he drew further scrutiny - particularly about his performances outside Asia which had been lacklustre at best.  <br/>  <br/> Switching formats, however, seemed to Gill a lot of good. He had an excellent series against England in early 2025 with scores of 87, 60 and 112, and he entered the 2025 Champions Trophy as the No.1 ODI batter. He started the tournament with an unbeaten 101* and although the runs dwindled thereafter, he finished the tournament with 188 runs - the third most for India after Shreyas Iyer and Virat Kohli.   <br/>  <br/> Still early days in his career, but the swashbuckling opener from Punjab is already being tipped as the next best thing in cricket, the flagbearer for India across formats in the years to follow.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Pratyush Sinha and Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "One of many left-arm orthodox spinners from Gujarat, Axar made his first-class debut for Gujarat at the tender age of 18, in a Vijay Hazare Trophy game in Mumbai and his Ranji Trophy debut in November 2012, but it was only in the 2013/14 season that he started to deliver performances of greater significance, picking up 29 wickets and scoring runs by the barrel. <br/>  <br/> Axar came into the public limelight after he was signed by the Mumbai Indians for the sixth edition of the IPL. Mumbai didn't give him an opportunity and he remained a fringe player for them throughout the season. Kings XI Punjab, however, roped him in for the next season, which turned out to be a successful move as he emerged as one of the exciting young talents in his first season with the franchise. <br/>  <br/> A self-proclaimed batting all-rounder, Patel had some trouble getting chances to bat up the order. Nevertheless, he troubled many batsmen with his accurate bowling, cramping them up for room and buying wickets - the need of the hour in T20 cricket. Axar ended his second IPL in 2014 with 17 wickets and also scored some crucial runs down the order. Most importantly though, Axar had come through with the ball for his captain George Bailey in pressure situations and was thereby a fine choice for the Emerging Player of the Tournament award. This earned him a period of probation with the Indian team at the tender age of 20, as he travelled to Bangladesh for the ODI series in 2014. He was impressive against Bangladesh and even did well enough to keep first choice left-armer Ravindra Jadeja out of the side in the home series against Sri Lanka. After an impressive showing, the selectors decided to persist with him and he retained his spot in the squad for the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. With the Indian bowling attack heavy on pace due to the more seam-friendly conditions in Australia, Axar had to sit out and didn't get a chance to play on the world's biggest stage. He was back in the mix in the subcontinent, though, as India toured Bangladesh in June.  <br/>  <br/> Axar, despite churning out some decent performances, was always under the shadow of the more experienced Ravindra Jadeja. He missed out on selection for the 2017 Champions Trophy and in the period that followed, he failed to break into the side on a regular basis even when Jadeja was absent due to injuries. He was named as a stand-by player for India’s 2019 Cricket World Cup squad. Pigeonholed as a limited-overs player, Axar’s Test debut only came in India’s home series against England in 2021 and he wasted no time to impress. He became only the ninth Indian bowler to take a fifer on debut when he recorded figures of 5-60 in the 2nd of the 2nd Test at Chennai. Axar finished as the second-highest wicket-taker of the series with 27 wickets to his name despite featuring in only 3 of the games. A string of good all-round performances thereafter meant that Axar was always in consideration for India in all three formats, especially when they needed a third spinner in sub-continent conditions.   <br/>  <br/> Since 2021, Axar has turned out to be a reliable performer for India, especially in white-ball formats and his improved batting also meant Test call-ups in home conditions. He was named in the 15-man squad for the 2023 home World Cup, but a left quadriceps strain dahed his hopes of featuring in a home ICC tournament. Axar though got a second chance and played a pivotal role in helping India achieve success in the next two ICC events, the 2024 T20 World Cup and the 2025 Champions Trophy. <br/>  <br/> Axar also achieved the unique feat of an IPL hat-trick when he took 4 wickets in 5 balls against the Gujarat Lions in 2016. While his batting wasn’t anything to write home about, Axar continued to be a tidy and dependable 4-overs bowler for the Punjab franchise in the following years. His reliable performances meant that he netted an INR 5 crore bid from the Delhi Capitals in the 2019 IPL Auction. His solid performances and his ever improving profile meant that the Capitals have been happy to retain him ahead of every auctions since then.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Rishi Roy</b> and <b>Anurag Hegde</b>",

      "bio": "An unknown quantity before the 2016-17 season, Mohammed Siraj, made a name for himself as he guided Hyderabad to a quarter-final finish in the Ranji Trophy, taking 41 wickets from nine matches and finishing as the third leading wicket-taker in the coveted tournament. A late bloomer as per Indian cricketing standards, Siraj took to serious cricket only in 2015. <br/>  <br/> That effort brought him immense recognition and a place in the Sunrisers Hyderabad franchise for the 10th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Despite not being that tall, Siraj's ability to procure pace and bounce impressed Tom Moody, Coach, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and he played a starring role as the franchise reached the knock-out stage of the competition. Such was the demand for the right-arm fast bowler that he went from a nominal base price of Rupees 20 lakhs INR to a final winning bid of Rupees 2.6 crores INR. Despite playing just six matches, he ended up with 10 wickets, although he was a touch expensive.  <br/>  <br/> The speedster missed out on the Ranji season in 2017-18 and played only one game but he was back for the Vijay Hazare trophy and starred with the ball for Hyderabad. He picked up 23 wickets in 7 games which included 3 5-wicket hauls. The 'Hyderabad Express' also nipped out 10 wickets from 5 games in the Syed Mushtaq Ali tourney.  <br/>  <br/> Siraj made his International debut in 2017, but never really stayed in the reckoning for the country. It was only in December, 2020 when Siraj made the world take notice of his abilities. He was picked for the MCG Test against Australia owing to an injury to Mohammed Shami, and made an impressive start to life as a Test cricketer. By the end of the series, Siraj was India’s strike Test bowler with the other regulars all being ruled out due to injury. His contributions were pivotal as India claimed a famous 2-1 away win against Australia.  <br/>  <br/> Siraj started to shine as an ODI bowler as well, and was lethal particularly in the powerplay. In January 2023, Siraj became the top ranked ODI bowler in the world. He produced a stunning spell of 6/21 in the 2023 Asia Cup final as India humbled Sri Lanka on their own patch. Siraj was part of the World Cup squad as well, sharing the new ball with Jasprit Bumrah.  <br/>  <br/> He was picked for the 2024 T20I World Cup as well, and played all the games in the USA leg of the tournament. When the competition moved to the West Indies, Siraj was replaced by Kuldeep Yadav. A serious grafter who has come through putting in the hard yards, Mohammad Siraj has now become a proper three format player for India, and a genuine wicket-taker in all conditions.   <br/>  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> The right-arm quick caught the eyeballs during the 2017 IPL auctions when Sunrisers Hyderabad bought him for INR 2.6 crore from a base price of 20 lakh. He didn't feature much as he got only six games, but he impressed by picking up 10 wickets. However, his erratic bowling nature worked against him as he was let go the next season.  <br/>  <br/> Royal Challengers Bangalore trying to form a new team identified Siraj's talent and went after him in the 2018 auctions. They beat four other franchises to land Siraj at Bangalore for INR 2.6 crore. He did not start the first few games but once picked he became Kohli's go-to death bowler and ended the season with 11 scalps and thus ensured he was retained for the following edition. <br/>  <br/> In his initial years, Siraj wasn’t the most accurate and conceded a lot of runs in the IPL, but he was a much improved player post 2022. Despite playing most of his games in the small dimensions of the Chinnaswamy Stadium, Siraj was the most reliable for RCB and always amongst the wickets. Ahead of the mega auctions, he wasn’t retained by Bangalore and was picked up by Gujarat Titans for 12.25 crores. ",

      "bio": "Seen as the next biggest thing from Kerala, Sanju Samson is a fine wicket-keeper batsman, who is sound in technique, both with bat and behind the stumps. A fan-favourite and a perennial underperformer at the international stage, Sanju Samson’s is a curious study. Having flattered to deceive on numerous occasions, Samson’s accomplishments in the IPL and at the domestic level only accentuated his unrealised potential at the highest level. He made his first-class debut at the age of 17 for Kerala against Vidarbha and made an impact almost immediately as he scored two hundreds and a fifty in five appearances the next season. He was signed by the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2012 but he did not get a game. It was for the Rajasthan Royals that Samson made a name for himself in the IPL in 2013. <br/>  <br/> Samson was sent to the UAE to represent the country in the 2012 Under-19 World Cup and he did not disappoint the selectors. He was the top run-getter for India and was the only player in the side to hit three fifties. In fact, he finished 6th in the list of batsmen with most runs in the entire tournament despite India not qualifying to the semi-final. <br/>  <br/> When Dravid was mentoring the Royals in IPL-7, he spoke highly of Samson and added that he is one of the players in the current lot who will excel for India in the near future. Consistent performances in the IPL meant Samson was picked for the Zimbabwe tour in 2015. He made his first appearance for India in a T20 game, where he scored 19. <br/>  <br/> Dravid once again showed his faith when he was the head coach of Delhi Daredevils and picked up Samson in the 2016 IPL auctions and the wicket-keeper repaid it by becoming the third highest run-scorer for his team. He was picked for the India A tour of Australia and played a few handy knocks, which helped them win the quadrangular series involving Australia A, South Africa A and National Performance Squad. During the 2014-15 season, the Keralite had gone so high up the pecking order that he was expected to be a successor to MS Dhoni as India's gloveman. Sadly, his fortunes plummeted since then. <br/>  <br/> Samson's game didn’t really go up the way it should have, considering the natural talent that he possesses. While he is capable of playing jaw-dropping strokes all around the ground, his temperament continued to be that of a rookie despite gaining experience in the domestic circuit. He had to wait another 4 years before returning to the national side in 2019 but his returns continued to remain bleak. While his outstanding performances at the IPL and domestic level meant he couldn’t be overlooked, his bleak performances at the international level meant he simply could not hold on to his spot. It wasn’t until 2024 that Samson was finally able to find some semblance of stability. In the interim, he had also played 16 ODIs and even scored a century. He was a part of the Indian squad that won the 2024 T20 World Cup but he didn’t feature in any game. Following the World Cup, Samson struck his maiden T20I century against Bangladesh and incidentally, it was the second fastest T20I century for India.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> A stylish shotmaker who also keeps wickets, Sanju Samson was initially part of the Kolkata Knight Riders but never got any opportunities there. It was his stint at the Rajasthan Royals that enabled him to showcase his talent to the world. During the 2013-15 phase, he was one of the vital cogs of the RR batting line-up, lending stability with his solid gameplay and also helping them accelerate with his sizzling strokeplay. Temperamental issues aside, Samson was considered a future superstar and his IPL exploits even saw him rise rapidly in the pecking order to be MS Dhoni’s successor. <br/>  <br/> However, over the years, he has never had that breakthrough season which would help him to push his case forward. Often, Samson would start an IPL season with a flurry of impressive scores, only to fizzle out as the tournament progressed. Lack of interest in glovework in domestic cricket set him back considerably and by the time he restarted being a gloveman, he had slipped a lot in the category of India’s wicket-keeper batsmen. A short stint with Delhi further saw Samson exhibiting his strengths but the weaknesses too remained the same. He got back to RR at the fresh auctions in 2018 and another underwhelming season ensued after it had begun well, again. 2019 wasn't all that different either. He kept showing glimpses of his brilliance, including a couple of centuries but the runs simply didn’t come with the desired consistency. <br/>  <br/> Samson continues to be one of RR’s mainstays in the middle order, particularly after being appointed as the skipper of the team in 2021, and given that he is a domestic recruit, adds more value as it allows the franchise to spread the overseas players in other departments. While he scored 531 runs from 15 games in 2024, Samson is still in search of that one big standout IPL season that will take his game to the next level. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Cricbuzz Staff</b>",

      "bio": "David Warner had one of the most memorable debuts in international cricket, when he was plucked from obscurity - without having played a single First-Class match - and made a stunning 89 off 43 balls in a T20l against South Africa. The innings was all the more remarkable due to its timing, coming as it did after a morale-shattering home Test series loss for Australia in 2008-09. <br/>  <br/> With T20 success, he made his ODI debut against the South Africans in Hobart. An aggressive 69 in just his second ODI seemed to confirm the rare talent of Warner. However, as the ODIs progressed, his form dipped and he was axed before forcing his way back into the side. He continued to impress in the T20 format of the game, and was one of the few bright spots during Australia's first round exit in the 2009 edition of the World T20 in England. <br/>  <br/> With a slot opening up in the Australian Test squad, Warner was one among the many choices. Already a regular in the ODI line-up, Warner made his Test debut against New Zealand in the Australian summer of 2011. After a modest debut at the Gabba, Warner came into his own with a career-defining century in Hobart. He belied expectations and became the 13th Australian opener to carry his bat through an innings. If the knock in Hobart was full of grit and determination, he showed another side of his batting abilities when he blasted a listless Indian bowling attack to all parts of the WACA during a stunning career-best knock of 180. Warner’s aggressive touch at the top of the order was in full flow once again when he creamed a superb 119 against a top notch South African attack at the Adelaide Oval in 2012. <br/>  <br/> On 12th June 2013, Warner was dropped for Australia's second match in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy game against New Zealand for disciplinary reasons. It later emerged that he had tried to punch Joe Root. The event happened hours after Saturday's loss to England at Edgbaston. On 13th June 2013, the board announced that Warner was to be fined £7,000 (AU $11,500) and would not play for his country until the first Ashes Test on 10th July, 2013. Warner, subsequently, missed the rest of the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy and the tour matches against Somerset and Worcestershire. <br/>  <br/> A month later on 27th July 2013, while playing for Australia 'A' against South Africa 'A' in Pretoria, Warner was involved in an on-field altercation with South Africa 'A' wicket-keeper, Thami Tsolekile. This was deemed serious enough for the umpires to step in twice, however, no formal complaints were made. He scored 193 in that match and he was eventually forgiven and was drafted into the Australian side for the third Test against England. What followed was even more comical as he 'hooked' one to Root and was caught on the boundary. <br/>  <br/> In the Ashes series in Australia in 2013-14, he scored runs freely and emerged as the highest run-scorer. He scored 523 runs from five matches at an average of 58.11, which included two hundreds and two fifties. <br/>  <br/> Warner bettered his own effort in The Ashes 2013-14 by once again becoming the highest run-getter in the three-match Test series against the No.1 ranked team South Africa. He scored a mind-blowing 543 runs from six innings at an average of 90.50, which included three hundreds, with two of those hundreds coming in the last Test. He was rightly declared as the Man of the Series. <br/>  <br/> Warner continued to do well in all formats and also scored a fine hundred in the first Test of Australia's UAE tour in 2014. He scored a fifty in the home ODI series against South Africa to stay in good shape and smashed three hundreds against India in the 2014-15 Border-Gavaskar Trophy to hurt the visitors badly. Warner was the second highest run-scorer for Australia in the 2015 World Cup. He amassed 345 runs in 8 games, which included a dashing 178 against Afghanistan, helping Australia to post 417 on board - the highest ever World Cup total. <br/>  <br/> Just like many of his colleagues, Warner had his share of problems against the swinging ball during the 2015 Ashes in England. The stocky Aussie compiled some fighting knocks and was one among the top three run-getters for his side during the all-important series. The pocket-rocket though had an incredible home summer (2016) as he struck 3 successive centuries against the Kiwis and was fittingly adjudged Man of the Series. <br/>  <br/> He backed it up with an 82-ball 100 against the Windies at the SCG in the Pink Test. What followed wasn't quite usual for Warner as he failed to repeat similar performances in New Zealand (both in Tests and ODIs). As if that wasn't enough, he was pushed down the order in T20Is which didn't work in his and the team's favour. He had a miserable World T20 in 2016. <br/>  <br/> He's never far from controversy, but what happened on the 2018 tour to South Africa could unfortunately be how his career is remembered. On that fateful afternoon of 24th March in Cape Town, when the cameras spotted Cameron Bancroft using a sandpaper to rub the ball, a crime he later accepted at the end of the day, Warner's name cropped up as being part of the 'leadership group' along with captain Steve Smith in a premeditated crime. What followed was massive outburst all over the cricketing world, with even the Prime Minister of Australia calling for action against these 'cheats'. <br/>  <br/> A Cricket Australia interrogation soon followed, leading to Warner being slapped with a one-year ban. The subsequent fallout included him losing out on his lucrative IPL deal and brand contracts. It was a year for Warner but he returned a stronger and hungrier man, as evident from his mind-boggling run in the 2019 IPL. It was a no-brainer for Australia to welcome him back to their squads and Warner was awarded a national contract for 2019-20 ahead of being named in Australia’s squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Roaring back to life in international cricket, Warner batted like a man possessed and gave Australia and the rest of the world a staunch reminder of what they had missed in the past year. On his first ODI back in Australian colors, Warner struck an unbeaten 89 in their game against Afghanistan and was adjudged the player of the match. As the tournament progressed, Warner only seemed to get better as Australia put up another dominant show at the World Cup. He struck a 107 against Pakistan, his first century upon return and backed that up with a 166 against Bangladesh just two games later. He struck another century, a 122 this time against South Africa in the last group-stage game and finished the tournament as Australia’s highest run-getter and the second highest overall, only behind Rohit Sharma, with 647 runs in 10 matches.  <br/>  <br/> That form, however, didn’t carry over to the following Ashes. In a dismal show, Warner only managed 95 runs from 10 innings with his best being 61. Warner seemed to have no answers, particularly against Stuart Broad to whom he fell a whopping 7 times. While he struggled in Test cricket though, Warner continued to plunder bowling attacks in the limited overs formats. In October of 2019, Warner struck his maiden T20I hundred in a game against Sri Lanka and became only the third Australian to score a hundred in all formats.  <br/>  <br/> His drought in Test cricket didn’t last long either. During the second Test of Pakistan’s 2019 Tour to Australia, Warner piled on the runs and struck his maiden Test triple hundred. In what was a day-night encounter at Adelaide, Warner meticulously dismantled Pakistan’s attack and Australia declared on 589/3 with Warner remaining unbeaten on 335.  <br/>  <br/> In the following year, Warner became the quickest Australian to 5000 ODI runs. He was a part of the Australian squad that won the 2021 T20 World Cup at home and was their standout performer. Amassing 289 runs, including a match-winning fifty in the final, Warner bagged the Player of the Tournament award. The story was vastly different in the 2022 T20 World Cup though as Warner had paltry returns, scoring just 44 runs in 4 games.  <br/>  <br/> Despite there being some notable performances, like a double-century against South Africa in the 2022 Boxing Day Test, the consistency that Warner was known for seemed to desert him. He struggled on overseas tours to Pakistan and Sri Lanka and serious questions about his place began surfacing after another sub-par performance in the 2023 Ashes. Despite not being in a rich vein of form and amidst much scrutiny, Warner was handed a spot in Australia’s 2023 World Cup squad, perhaps as one last shot at redemption.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> Overseas players are a prized asset to any franchise in the IPL, or any league for that matter. That David Warner has been the most successful overseas batsman in the history of the IPL is saying something. Warner has been a key player at the top of the order for the franchises he has represented - Delhi Daredevils from 2009 to 2013, the Sunrisers Hyderabad from 2014 to 2020 and the Delhi Capitals since 2021. Warner had an average first season with the Daredevils, scoring at an average of 23, and a relatively low strike rate in the 120s. <br/>  <br/> The switch to the Sunrisers worked wonders for the southpaw, after he was contracted by the franchise for US$880,000. In 2015, Warner was given the leadership role for SRH. He failed to take his side through to the playoffs, but he won himself the orange cap in the 2015 season for scoring the most number of runs (562). In the following season, he went a step further, leading his side to their maiden title in 2016 by beating RCB in the final. He contributed handsomely in the final, with a 38-ball 69, and ended the tournament as the second-highest run-scorer (848). His side failed to make the final in 2017, but he won himself his second Orange cap (641 runs at 58.27). However, he was banned by the BCCI from playing the 2018 IPL season after ball-tampering allegations in the Newlands Test. Returning to the side under Kane Williamson’s leadership, Warner had another stellar IPL in 2019. In just his second game back, Warner scored an unbeaten 55-ball 100 to announce his return. He won his 3rd Orange Cap that season after scoring 692 runs from just 12 games. <br/>  <br/> In 2020, Warner found himself leading the Sunrisers again and his pristine consistency with the bat continued. He became the first overseas batter to amass 5000 runs in the IPL and ended the season with 548 runs with his side bowing out after a loss to the Delhi Capitals in Qualifier 2. Like in the past, however, controversy was always around the corner for Warner. The 2021 edition of the IPL saw Warner being dropped from the side half-way through the tournament and his exclusion was labelled as a “non-cricketing decision”, hinting that all was not well behind the scenes. After what was an obvious and bitter fallout between the Sunrisers and Warner, he returned to the Auction table in 2022 and was picked up by the Delhi Capitals for INR 2 crore. He was also named the captain of the side for the 2023 edition after regular captain, Rishabh Pant, was ruled out of the season following a harrowing car-crash.",

      "bio": "A fiery Pat Cummins set the international arena ablaze with his Test debut in 2011 on a juicy Wanderers pitch. A seven-wicket match haul including a six-fer in the second innings gave Australia a chaseable score which they eventually gunned down, albeit by a narrow margin. Amidst the victory celebrations, the talk was all about this exciting fast bowler who had all the weapons a pacer needed. He was impeccably complete, that too at such an early age which promised so much. Tragedy struck though, which meant that he didn't play a single Test match for about six years. <br/>  <br/> Cummins' has no real weakness in his skill set but a fragile body meant that he couldn't capitalize on the sensational debut that he had. Although he did feature in white-ball cricket during this Test hiatus, there too he wasn't a regular starter with injuries inevitably consuming him at frequent intervals. It did seem like such a powerhouse of talent would end up combusting in the flame of injuries. However, the 2016-17 season saw Cummins upping his fitness levels in a big way. After a few years of constant preparation, it seemed like the body was finally starting to be stable. <br/>  <br/> Cummins was picked for the Test tour of India in early 2017 and this was an examination for him in all aspects. The sub-continent isn't the best place for a fast bowler due to the pitches and the temperature levels. Add to that Cummins' inherent fragility and there were concerns on how he would pull up. But he put all that to rest by featuring in two Tests back to back and seemed quite hungry for more. The IPL season that year saw him play more competitive cricket and the presence of Indian pace great Zaheer Khan helped Cummins' mould himself a lot better. <br/>  <br/> Despite the progress, Cummins still had to consistently keep the good work going for putting his career on track. The Bangladesh tour saw Cummins progressing well and after proving his fitness over a long period of time, he got the nod for the all-important Ashes series at home in 2017-18. It was the ideal opportunity to make a statement and Cummins didn't let it go. He had an excellent series, often claiming crucial breakthroughs and also made invaluable contributions with the bat. Australia regained the urn and the cricketing world was convinced that Cummins was here to stay for long. <br/>  <br/> Cummins’ career just kept going from strength to strength thereafter. He was named as Australia’s Test vice-captain alongside Travis Head in early 2019 and he won the Allan Border medal the following month for his efforts over the past 12 months. He also ascended to number 1 on ICC’s Test Bowling rankings and became the first Australian bowler since Glenn McGrath to do so. He was part of the Australian squad that played the 2019 Cricket World Cup but didn’t have any notable returns. In the Ashes series that followed, however, Cummins was the standout performer. With 29 wickets in the 5 games, Cummins was the leading wicket-taker across both teams.  <br/>  <br/> In a historic move, Cummins was named Australia’s full-time captain in 2021 just ahead of the Ashes series following Tim Paine’s resignation. He became the first Australian fast-bowler to take up the job full-time and Steve Smith was named his deputy. He led Australia’s successful Ashes campaign as they went on to win by a convincing 4-0 margin. Cummins also took over as Australia’s limited-overs captain following Aaron Finch’s retirement in 2022.  <br/>  <br/> Cummins’ first major title win as captain was the World Test Championship in 2023. Under his leadership, Australia beat India by a massive 209-run margin at The Oval. Cummins was named as the captain of Australia’s 15-member squad for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Cummins was sensational in the 2023 World Cup, particularly the final where he led by example. He excelled at almost exclusively bowling slower bouncers and cutters as the Indian batters just couldn’t get him away. Cummins got the wickets of Shreyas Iyer and Virat Kohli in the final, as the hosts scored an under par total and Australia were able to silence over a lakh spectators to reclaim the World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Cummins continued his fine form into the Test summer, as Australia whitewashed Pakistan 3-0, but he was jolted back to reality by a Shamar Joseph inspired West Indies who upset the apple cart by defeating the Aussies at Gabba. His heroics weren’t just restricted to Test cricket, as Cummins made a mark in the 2024 T20 World Cup as well where he became the first player to pick up hat-tricks in consecutive matches.  <br/>  <br/> Australian cricket’s blue eyed boy who has a penchant for clutch performances, Pat Cummins is now showing his prowess as a leader as well. He seems to have galvanized Australian cricket in the right direction once again, and only time will tell if we are heading for another decade of Aussie dominance with Pat Cummins at the helm.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL Through the Years</b> <br/> Cummins got his first taste of the IPL in 2014, when he was picked by Kolkata Knight Riders. Opportunities were few and far in the first two seasons in the IPL, as he failed to really make a mark. Cummins returned to the auctions in 2017, and this time he was picked by Delhi Capitals. He performed admirably, picking 14 wickets in 12 games but the franchise finished towards the bottom that season.  <br/>  <br/> The lanky pacer then took a two year hiatus from the tournament, before becoming one of the most in demand players in 2020. He was signed for 15.5 crores by Kolkata Knight Riders and played with them for the next couple of seasons. Cummins performed decently with the ball without really setting the world on fire, while one of his finest moments for KKR actually came with bat in hand - when he scored a 14 ball fifty against Mumbai Indians.  <br/>  <br/> In 2023, shortly after the ODI World Cup triumph, Cummins once again was the most talked about player heading into the auctions. He was signed by Sunrisers Hyderabad for 20.5 crores, which made him the second most expensive player for that season. He was named captain and took his franchise to the final, playing a refreshingly attacking brand of cricket. Cummins was retained by SRH ahead of the mega auctions.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan</b> and <b>Anurag Hegde</b>",

      "bio": "With the Sehwag-esque ability to enthrall as well as exasperate, Glenn Maxwell blurred the line copy-book and agricultural, pulling off unorthodoxy with ease and fluency. Making use of his athleticism and quick responses, Maxwell revolutionized the modern limited-overs game with the ability to let his instincts guide his responses to the ball. The twist is that the said response may not necessarily be a shot that has ever been witnessed on a cricket field. <br/> A fielding captain's nightmare, the Big Show pulls off the shots of our wildest dreams with utmost swagger and gusto. Audio and text commentators' jobs hang by a fickle thread as he pulls off some indescribable shots. And yet, when he fails to pull 'em off, our hearts sink; the day wouldn't be as exciting as it could have been if Maxwell got going. <br/>  <br/> Unconventional may be an understatement to describe Maxwell's unorthodoxy; however, he rose through the ranks in conventional fashion and shot to instant fame when the 22-year old rookie clubbed his way to the fastest fifty in domestic One-Day history in the Ryobi Cup. He followed this up with some now-familiar violent performances in the emerging players tournament and tormented the Indian and South African sides with some fearsome hitting, scoring 59 off 23 against India and 110 off 52 against South Africa. <br/>  <br/> Maxwell was handed an ODI and T20I debut, owing to his consistent limited-over performances in the domestic circuit. He had some good all-round outings, playing the jack-of-all-trades role for Australia, including a 56 against Pakistan in his 2nd ODI. However, he remained a fringe player and didn't manage to cement his spot in the side. However, with the backing of excellent domestic form and some useful performances in International cricket, along with his handy off-spin bowling, he was picked in the squad for the 2012 World T20 in Sri Lanka. <br/>  <br/> Maxwell continued to be impressive in the limited-overs format, and was finally handed the prized Baggy Green for the second Test against India at Hyderabad in 2013. He failed to impress with the bat but took four in an innings with the ball. However, he was subsequently dropped for the third Test in Mohali, where Xavier Doherty was given a chance. After Australia lost the Mohali Test, Maxwell was given another opportunity in the final test in Delhi. Once again, he failed to make an impression with the bat and was subsequently dropped. <br/> In the upcoming IPL, however, the Big Show was the talk of the town, having signed with the Mumbai Indians for $1 million. He was transferred to Kings XI Punjab in the 2014 edition, and struck form immediately, scoring 7 fifties in the tournament, including 3 scores in the nineties. He was fast becoming a nightmare for the captains in the IPL; and with the boundary ropes pulled in, the big man was mis-hitting blows off the edge, beyond the rope. <br/>  <br/> Now a mainstay in Australia's limited-overs side, Maxwell continued to play the role of the quintessential bits-and-pieces cricketer. He had a dip in form towards the end of 2014, but was retained for the 2015 World Cup, with the selectors taking a giant leap of faith. Maxwell responded in kind by contributing handsomely, scoring 324 runs in the World Cup at an average of 64.80 and an unprecedented strike-rate of 182. He continued to torment Sri Lanka, lacing 145 off 65 balls in a T20I at Pallekele, the second highest score of all-time in T20Is. <br/>  <br/> Maxwell had a torrid time in first-class cricket in 2016/17, as his attempted move to New South Wales was rejected and he was controversially dropped from the Victorian side for the opening game of the Sheffield Shield. He was picked after that and had some underwhelming outings with just one fifty in 5 innings. <br/>  <br/> On the tour to India in 2017, Maxwell was handed a Test comeback in Ranchi and he grabbed the opportunity with both hands, scoring an uncharacteristically patient maiden Test hundred and securing a draw for Australia. He retained his spot for the final Test against India and the subsequent tour to Bangladesh as well. However, with his dipping form, he was dropped from Tests again in favour of Shaun Marsh. He continued to knock on the selectors' door as he made a typically aggressive 278 in the 2017/18 Sheffield Shield, but failed to nail his spot in the side, perhaps more because of his temperamental ability to consistently do what he did in the Ranchi Test and grind the bowlers out, than due to technical shortcomings. His freak-ish innings of 127 off 102 against New South Wales, after coming in with the scoreline at a sorry 9 for 6, was appreciable, but also highlighted his inability to grind it out, and his tendency to hit his way out of trouble (which happened to work, in this case). <br/>  <br/> Nonetheless, the Big Show continues to be a threat in the shorter forms of the game. In the BBL, he's been as prolific and the 2018-19 season was eventful as he led the Melbourne Stars into the final and himself had a good season as well. Maxwell also got his form going in ODIs at the start of 2019 in the absence of Warner-Smith, taking more responsibility and that ensured that his shaky-looking World Cup spot got cemented. He had a lackluster performance at the World Cup but maintained his spot.  <br/>  <br/> In the following years, Maxwell was a vital cog in Australia’s limited overs setup. Despite suffering some setbacks due to injury, he was a part of both the 2021 T20 World Cup that Australia went on to win and the subsequent 2022 T20 World Cup. Making a comeback from injury, Maxwell was named in Australia’s 2023 Cricket World Cup squad. Despite being a regular for Australia in white-ball cricket, Maxwell last played Test cricket back in 2017.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Rishi Roy</b>",

      "bio": "Mitchell Starc – a name that strikes fear into the hearts of contemporary batsmen. It is hard to fathom that the tall and skinny lad from Sydney, who was once an aspiring wicketkeeper in junior cricket, would one day become the most menacing sight for the world's best batsmen. <br/> Legend has it that a tall, lanky 14-year-old was spotted by a club coach trying out as a wicketkeeper for the Western Suburbs. He pulled the young man aside and demanded that he ditch the wicketkeeping mitts – and that he would teach him how to bowl. The AFL's fabled method of scouting a body-type and building a particular skill around it seemed to be at work again, as it tends to work in favour of the player's ability and aptitude. <br/>  <br/> It is a tried and tested method. Case in point: three decades ago, Dennis Lillee, then in charge of the MRF pace foundation, told a 14-year-old Indian boy of short stature that he couldn't be a fast bowler. Following the incident, the aspiring fast bowler changed lanes and took up batting. We all know how that turned out... <br/>  <br/> Starc, the teenager, seemed to have grasped fast-bowling quite quickly, picking up the fundamentals from the aforementioned coach, Neil D'Costa, and bowling at 135km/h by the time he was 16. In addition to athletic ability, he was said to have great discipline and an undying thirst for knowledge. Most crucially, however, he was a great listener, according to D'Costa. Soon after, he was selected for the New South Wales U-17s, and continued to rise through the ranks. <br/>  <br/> After impressive performances in junior cricket, he was finally handed a Sheffield Shield debut for the New South Wales at the age of 19 but managed just 2 wickets in the match. In the following Shield season, he took 21 wickets in 8 matches including an impressive 5/74 against Queensland. The first run of consistent performances by Starc came in the domestic One-Day tournament when he took 26 wickets in 6 matches at an average of 8.12, striking once every 12 balls. Starc was named the player of the tournament, as the young prodigy catapulted his team to victory. This proved to be the turning point in his career and finally propelled him into the limelight for national selection. <br/>  <br/> At 20, Starc was named in the squad as a backup quick bowler for the short Test series in India in late 2010. Unfortunately, he didn't get his hands on the coveted Baggy Green during that tour, as the Aussies already had a left-arm pacer, Mitchell Johnson, in their playing XI. Right-arm bowler Peter George was given preference over him in the second Test and Starc had to be content with warming the bench and bowling in the nets. <br/>  <br/> Owing to a plethora of injuries in the team and stellar domestic performances, he finally received the Baggy Green, playing New Zealand at the Gabba in late 2011. His debut Test was largely underwhelming, as he leaked runs at an alarming rate and took only 2 wickets in the match. He took 2 further wickets in the succeeding Hobart Test and didn't impress much with his control, clocking in the higher 130s, struggling to swing the Kookaburra, and most importantly, lacking intensity. He continued to get limited chances, as he was dropped from the squad for the first two home Tests against India, but got his opportunity in the third Test on a hostile Perth wicket. He fared much better on this tour, showing better control and the ability to move the ball both ways in the air. Most notably, he had the great Sachin Tendular playing down the wrong line and got him out LBW. <br/>  <br/> However, he still hadn't performed well enough to cement his spot in the side, given the fiercely competitive assembly of fast-bowlers in the Australian circuit. To sharpen his skills and increase his versatility, he needed to travel and acclimatize himself to different conditions. He went to England and had a stint in county cricket with Yorkshire to learn the nuances and finer points of swinging the Dukes ball. <br/>  <br/> There was something that he did right in England. Because the man who returned was Mitchell Starc 2.0. <br/>  <br/> Upon return to international cricket, he notched up three 5-wicket hauls in quick succession against the West Indies and Pakistan in early 2014, thereby cementing his spot in the ODI side. This ensured that he got more backing with the red cherry as well, but things weren't quite as smooth-sailing in Tests, especially because he was hit by a string of injuries during the 2013/14 season. To make things worse, Starc went wicketless in 4 out of 10 Test innings leading up to 2nd innings of the Brisbane Test against India in December 2014. <br/>  <br/> After another wicketless performance, which was becoming the talk of the town amongst the critics, Shane Warne publicly made a statement urging Starc 'to change his body-language' and that he seemed 'too soft'. This could've been meant as constructive criticism or a spiteful comment. He also had the looming prospect of the upcoming World Cup in mind. <br/> Something had lit a fire under him. <br/>  <br/> He was not content with being the ODI spearhead. He was working on his Test game and wanted to establish himself as the leader of the attack in all forms of the game. The Carlton tri-series, about a month before the World Cup, was a sign of things to come. He was the highest wicket-taker of the series, bagging a best of 6/43 and a total of 12 wickets with his searing yorkers. But the stats won't tell you about the pace he had put on, hurling in toe-crushers at close to 150km/h. This was the trial run of the Frankenstein's monster; the calm before the storm. <br/>  <br/> And thus began the fairy tale of Mitchell Aaron Starc. <br/>  <br/> The monster was unleashed upon the unsuspecting teams, who had just landed Down Under for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 hosted by Australia and New Zealand. Starc tore through batting line-ups consistently, generating express pace throughout the tournament and tormenting batsmen with a blend of chin music and searing toe-crushing yorkers. His dream-run continued in the World Cup final as he returned with miserly figures of 8-1-20-2. More importantly, he picked up the prized scalp of Brendon McCullum, who had been ferocious against the new ball throughout the tournament, for a duck. <br/>  <br/> Unsurprisingly, he was declared the man of the tournament, picking up 22 wickets in the tournament at an average of 10.18 and a startling economy rate of 3.50 (in a tournament which saw twenty-eight 300+ totals and three 400+ totals being scored). Starc shot to the number 1 spot in the ICC ODI rankings after the break-through World Cup campaign. He consequently joined a league of extraordinary gentlemen (which includes Glenn McGrath and Sachin Tendulkar) to have won the Man of the Tournament award in a World Cup. <br/>  <br/> The World Cup was a landmark tournament for Starc, and it was only after he had established himself as the spearhead of the Australian attack in all formats, that he finally opened himself up to the IPL in 2014. Starc garnered a lot of praise for prioritizing international duties over franchise-based T20 cricket. 2015 continued to be his golden year in terms of numbers as well as fitness, as he broke the 160km/h barrier against New Zealand at WACA Test in November 2015. He picked up the highest number of international wickets in the 2015 calendar year as well (87) and continued his upward climb, establishing himself as an indispensable asset for Australian cricket. <br/>  <br/> After a series of injuries, especially to his landing foot, he started to pick and choose his series, resting himself enough to play the more important series. He strengthened his away record in the 2016 Test series in Sri Lanka, picking up career-best figures of 11/94 at Galle, albeit in a losing cause. In the closely fought Ashes in 2015, Starc impressed again with 18 wickets, the highest wicket-taker for the Australians in the series (second-highest overall), further improving his overseas credentials. <br/>  <br/> In February 2017, Starc parted ways with the Royal Challengers Bangalore to focus on international cricket, once again exhibiting that the national team remains his first priority. He was the third-highest wicket-taker in the inaugural Big Bash League, picking up 13 wickets and leading the Sixers to the title with his fiery bowling.  <br/>  <br/> During the build-up to the 2017/18 Ashes in Australia, Starc once again pulled off the unfathomable, picking up 2 hat-tricks in a Sheffield Shield match against Western Australia in Sydney, becoming the first man to achieve this feat. His dismissal of James Vince in the 2nd innings of the Perth Test was hailed as 'the ball of the 21st century': it was headed to go down leg side, hit a crack, and deviated almost half a meter(42cm) to hit the top of off-stump. More importantly, it was a crucial wicket in the context of the match, as Vince had made a half-century and was well on course to pull off a blockathon to save the Test. <br/>  <br/> Starc started off his 2019 World Cup campaign with a bang as he picked up 5 wickets in a game against the West Indies that his team went on to win. He went on to scalp two 5-fers and eventually finished the tournament with 27 wickets - an all-time World Cup record. In the subsequent Ashes, Starc only played one Test as Australia chose to rotate their fast bowlers around.  <br/>  <br/> He was a part of Australia’s squad for the twin T20 World Cups of 2021 and 2022 but didn’t have any performances of note. Come the Ashes again, however, and Starc was back at his best. In the 2021-22 Ashes, Starc was the 2nd-highest wicket-taker with 19 wickets from 5 games. He was also instrumental with the bat - scoring invaluable runs down the order. His batting tally read 155 runs at an average of 38.75, quite remarkable considering he batted lower down the order.  <br/>  <br/> Multiple different injuries continued to plague Starc. When he was fit and ready though, he was always a part of Australia’s setup across formats. The Ashes once again brought the best out of Starc and he ended the 2023 edition as the leading wicket-taker with 23 wickets.  <br/> After recovering in time from a niggle, Starc was named in Australia’s squad for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Being an express-pace bowler, he might not top too many all-time wicket-taking charts; but he has already etched his name in history as one of Australia's greatest fast bowlers.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL Through the Years</b> <br/> Starc entered the IPL Auctions for the first time in 2014, having already made a reputation for himself as a fiery pacer with a lethal yorker. He was signed by Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2014. His first year in the IPL was fairly mediocre, with the highlight probably being an on field altercation with Kieron Pollard.  <br/>  <br/> In 2015, Starc was a lot more lethal. He joined the team late due to an injury, but hit the blocks running to finish as RCB’s leading wicket taker. The franchise were bottom before Starc’s arrival, and post that managed to make it to the playoffs.  <br/>  <br/> Injuries and workload management forced a 9 year hiatus from the IPL then for Mitchell Starc, as he oftentimes also prioritised his Test career and avoided from enlisting for the IPL. Starc re-entered the auctions in 2024 and he became the most expensive player for the season, picked up for 24.75 crores by Kolkata Knight Riders. Starc showed his value that season with big performances in the semi-final and final, as KKR won the title for the first time since 2014. His hefty price tag made it difficult for KKR to retain him, and he will now be seen playing for Delhi Capitals in 2025.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Interesting facts:</b> <br/> <i>- Starc is of Slovenian descent.</i> <br/> <i>- Mitchell's younger brother, Brandon, is an Olympic high-jumper, having represented Australia in the Rio games in 2016 (Game of Thrones reference, anyone?).</i> <br/> <i>- When Starc toured India in 2013, he was dismissed for a heart-breaking 99 in the Mohali Test. In the same Test, he also became the first batsman lower-order batsman (positions 9-11) to have survived over 100 balls in each innings.</i> <br/> <i>- Starc got married to Alyssa Healy (a wicketkeeper for the Australian womens' team and niece of former Australia glovesman, Ian Healy) on the 15th of April 2015, 17 days after lifting the World Cup trophy at the MCG.</i> <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Rishi Roy</b>",

      "bio": "Ricky Ponting had all the ingredients of a typical Australian - tough as nails, aggressive, vocal and above all, mentally powerful to tackle pressure situations. The best quality about Ponting was his burning desire to win matches and at times, the desperation did bring up infamous incidents but what shone through his career was the sheer desire to be victorious. Three World Cup titles including two consecutive ones as captain to go with a couple of Champions Trophy titles and the no.1 Test ranking shows that he had seen it all in the international arena. Adding to all this was of course his free-wheeling strokeplay as a batsman, amassing runs at will and destroying opposition bowlers. The only title that eluded him was the World T20 but one could argue that the format came around the time that Ponting was in his final years. <br/>  <br/> A young and raw Ricky Ponting burst into the international arena in the year 1995 as he debuted in both the formats. He had garnered a big reputation in the domestic circuit for having the ability to produce the big runs and most people were in awe of his skill set. However, disciplinary issues were equally prevalent with Ricky back then and it did hound him in the initial years of his international career as well. But, he managed to pick himself up and from the 1998-99 season, started to mature steadily into a top flight batsman. Having started out as a middle order batsman, he also started to take ownership of the pivotal number three slot which he would make iconic in the years to follow.  <br/>  <br/> A highlight of Ponting's batting was the sheer intent he had, right from the first ball. It wouldn't necessarily be an aerial shot, would just be that positive trigger movement forward and he didn't mind playing the pull/hook shot even off the front foot with incredible ease. In fact, that stroke went onto become Ponting's signature shot in his career. He rarely let the bowlers to dictate terms and most of the times, bullied them into submission. His upward spike as a batsman meant that the leadership role wasn't far away. With Steve Waugh declining, captaincy finally came to Ponting in 2002 when he was at the peak of his powers as a batsman. Over the next 5 years, not only did he as a captain win consecutive World Cups and Champions Trophy titles, but also went up to another level as a batsman. <br/>  <br/> From 2002-2007, Ponting smashed an insane 41 international centuries across formats - testimony of the dominance he had over the bowlers. Apart from the limited-overs glory, Australia were also ruthless in Tests, carrying forward the legacy created by Steve Waugh. However, it wasn't all rosy for Ricky, especially in the longest format where the pain of losing the Ashes series happened to him thrice. It wasn't hard to understand the fact that he enjoyed captaining in the shorter format more as his creativity worked well in white-ball cricket whereas in Tests, his tactics were mostly revolving around the starry bowling attack. Once the senior bowlers left, Ponting started to feel the heat and although the story was similar in ODIs, he had a better grip over proceedings. <br/>  <br/> After the 2011 World Cup where Australia were eliminated in the quarterfinal, Ponting stood down from leadership and Michael Clarke was thrust to the role for all formats. 'Punter' as he is fondly called, barely played any games after giving up captaincy and bid farewell to international cricket in the 2012-13 home series against South Africa. His last year for Australia was fidgety, as is the case with most ageing players and hence, wasn't able to end on a high. Nevertheless, Ponting's contributions are invaluable to Australian cricket and he remains the second best batsman ever produced by the country after the Don. Apart from the several silverware that we won, there were a plethora of records that he created which may be tough if not impossible to break. <br/>  <br/> At the time of his retirement, Ponting was only second to Sachin Tendulkar in terms of total international runs and centuries. A true legend of the game, Ricky even played a part in the IPL although not much with much individual success. After a few torrid years with KKR, he shifted to MI where he even opened with Tendulkar - a rare feast for cricket lovers. However, Ponting soon realized that he wasn't adjusting well enough to the format and gave up captaincy to become a mentor of the side. That same season MI won their first ever IPL trophy and Ponting coached them to their second one in 2015. Ponting harbors hopes of coaching the Australian team and has even been a stop-gap replacement at times, especially in T20s. When not doing such assignments, he works as  TV commentator and is a delight to listen. <br/>  <br/> <b>By Hariprasad Sadanandan</b> <br/> ",

      "bio": "Michael Clarke is among those rare Australian cricketers who saw his side's fortunes go a full circle through his career. As a young prodigious talent, he was part of the invincible side that mercilessly hammered opponents and as he matured, the team started to age a bit which meant that the golden era was about to come to a halt. Finally, when he was appointed captain, it was time to rebuild but his aggressive brand of leadership saw Australia briefly reaching top ranking in Tests apart from an Ashes whitewash win and eventually, a World Cup title in 2015. His ODI retirement was timed perfectly as he bowed out after the victorious campaign while in Tests, it came at the end of an Ashes series defeat. When a teammate who was also extremely close to him, passed away, Clarke took it upon him to control things despite himself breaking down emotionally. 'Pup' as he is fondly called, saw all the highs and lows that you would associate with the game.  <br/>  <br/> It was as a blonde-haired free wheeling strokemaker that Clarke first stormed the international arena in the ODI format in early 2003. The prodigious talent wasn't hard to spot, he had all the shots in the book and also great footwork against the spinners which made him a compelling package to have in the side. The early ODI success translated into a Test cap in 2004 and Clarke started the longest format pretty much the way he had in the 50-overs one. Ironically, for a man who had come into the team for his adventurous brand of strokeplay, it was in Tests that Clarke established himself in a big way although he ended up with really good numbers in ODIs as well.  He did have some lean patches though, particularly in 2005 when Australia lost the Ashes in England and then in 2010-11, again during a phase when the urn was lost, this time at home. These times apart, Clarke made truckload of runs and seemingly loved the challenge which came with captaincy in late 2011. <br/>  <br/> Without doubt, 2012 was Clarke's best year in Tests by some distance. He notched up two triple tons and as many double tons in the year with breathtaking ease. His fabulous run scoring inspired the Australian side that was rebuilding post the retirements of Ricky Ponting and Mike Hussey. Needless to say, he was the fulcrum of the batting and the pressure just seemed to make him play better. Although the initial years of his captaincy didn't see any great success, eventually the Ashes whitewash at home came during 2013-14, which was sweet revenge for the defeat in England that had happened barely six months earlier. What pleased him more was that the win was a collective effort with quite a lot of matchwinners like Mitchell Johnson, Ryan Harris, Brad Haddin, Steve Smith etc to name a few. Clarke also got some runs but he didn't have to shoulder the burden on his own which was a relief to him. The Ashes win was followed by a tough series win in South Africa which propelled Australia to the top of the rankings. <br/>  <br/> Clarke's proactive captaincy was immensely lauded in Australia's Test success but his ODI career was clearly limping along due to the recurring back injuries that he was encountering. His preference for Tests meant that he would often take breaks during the ODI legs of a series that was captained by George Bailey. However, Clarke did have a hope of finishing his 50-over career with a World Cup and with the 2015 edition to be held at home, he worked hard to make the tournament as the captain of the side. It won't be wrong to say that he might not have made the cut if he wasn't the captain of the side. Reason being, Australia's limited-overs side were brimming with players who were capable of creating a far bigger impact than Clarke whose white-ball game had declined a bit despite still being resourceful. His unsung contributions over the years meant that he did get to lead a formidable side that eventually sealed the title at the MCG, thereby giving a joyous farewell to their skipper from the format. <br/>  <br/> Injuries meant that Clarke couldn't quite prolong his Test career as he would have liked. Also, an Ashes defeat does have consequences and although it was only a 2-3 defeat to England in their den in 2015, he had decided to call it quits as soon as the series was lost. The emergence of Steven Smith, both as a prolific run getter as well as potential leader might have been another factor that influenced Clarke's thinking. Smith had led the side briefly during the home series against India in his skipper's absence. Clarke was also emotionally drained, with the Phil Hughes demise happening just before that series and Australia responded by dedicating the World Cup title to their late teamman. Clarke was at the forefront of handling the issue, both as captain as well as family friend to the Hughes family. It was an act that earned a lot of respect from various quarters of the globe. Perhaps the emotional turmoil and more importantly, injuries played a part in Clarke exiting from international cricket. <br/>  <br/> Predominantly a batsman who loved to thrill the crowd with his shot making, Clarke's bowling was more than useful as he proved on the rank turners of India once with a 6-fer in Mumbai. He had the ability to get enough turn if the surface assisted the spinners and was fairly accurate as well. As his career progressed, back injuries hampered his bowling to some extent but couldn't stop his fielding heroics. Like many Australians, he was also an exceptional fielder who could be stationed anywhere on the park. He was agile, acrobatic and had an extremely powerful arm. It's this wholesome package which impressed many during his early days and eventually, Clarke made batting his only real contribution to a game due to the physical vulnerabilities that he had developed over the years. Perhaps as a captain, he was a reluctant bowler too - something that has happened a lot with many players. <br/>  <br/> Clarke loved to take the game forward as a captain, especially in Tests where he made plenty of eyebrow-raising declarations to force a result. Once, he even declared on the first day of a Test in India with hardly a threatening total on the board, just to get a few overs late in the day against the opponents. His leadership had intent which was necessary to compensate the lack of intimidation his Australian side had when compared to their predecessors. He might not have had a great success ratio as captain in the longest format but certainly contributed to making it entertaining. Despite all his pros as a skipper, there were some scathing negatives too. Many a time, there were differences within the camp and a few players had been vocal about Clarke's inability to mingle with everyone equally. His slightly elite background forced the press also to speculate as to whether he had ego issues. Some embarrassing incidents, like the Homeworkgate scandal on the tour of India in 2013 are pointers that harmony wasn't always there under his leadership. <br/>  <br/> In spite of the cons, Clarke's contribution to Australian cricket as well as international cricket was immense. A flamboyant batsman who incorporated impeccable grit to his game, Clarke's best years as a batsman were testimony of what mental strength can do. He faced the best of bowlers in their meanest of spells without flinching. His heroics against the South African pacers come to mind instantly, especially towards the fag end in 2014 when he received a barrage from Morne Morkel but stayed unfazed to produce a quality ton. Although he came in as a dapper of a strokemaker, he wasn't able to adapt to the latest T20 format as much as he would have liked to. Clarke was part of the Indian Premier League as well, briefly, but success didn't quite come to him there as well. After his international retirement, he has been an active voice in the Channel 9 commentary box apart from also travelling around the world for the same. <br/>  <br/> <b>By Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "Arguably the finest limited-overs all-rounder of the modern era, Shane Watson was the ideal package for white-ball cricket. He had the power game, could handle pace and spin with equal ease apart from being a clever medium pacer himself. Like most all-rounders, he also began his international career in the middle order before eventually being promoted as an opener. It was while batting at the top of the innings that Watson made some of his most destructive knocks - notably the semi-final and final knocks of the 2009 Champions Trophy where he almost single-handedly took Australia to the title. <br/>  <br/> Watson made his international debut in 2002 during the tour of South Africa in the ODI series. Australia had just appointed Ricky Ponting as the skipper and also decided to make a selection overhaul of sorts. With their obsession for bits-and-pieces all-rounders, Watson was an obvious selection considering that he was more than just a utility all-rounder. However, fitness was a big issue for him, as it would turn out to be throughout his career. He had to battle his body more times than he had to deal with bad form and that's telling a lot. Despite all that, Watson had a fairly good international career, especially in limited-overs cricket where he truly shone. <br/>  <br/> The success in white-ball cricket gave Watson the chance in Tests in 2005 but injuries plagued him in a big way which meant that he had to wait till the 2008-09 season to play the format frequently. Like in ODIs, here also Watson started off as a middle order batsman before being pushed to the opening slot in the midst of a grueling Ashes series. He didn't struggle as many expected he would, instead started the new role with a flourish but that move to send him to the top in Tests was probably in hindsight a confidence-destroying move to his Test career. Although he had success in the initial phase as an opener, the bowlers then started sorting him out, particularly with the LBW trap due to his tendency to play around the front pad. <br/>  <br/> The latter stages of Watson's Test career was a blob as he huffed and puffed in the format. Nevertheless, he did play a few fine knocks as well although most of them got clouded by the dismal finish to his career. However, he was always a force to reckon with in the shorter formats. The T20 format was also his pet - he had exceptional success not only for Australia but also in the IPL where he became a household name due to his all-round skills. After the Ashes defeat in England in 2015, Watson decided to quit from Tests. He played the ODIs that followed but was dropped soon after and in 2016, decided to call it quits from all forms of cricket. <br/>  <br/> It won't be wrong to say that Watson hasn't always been talked about as much as he deserved to. He didn't have a lovable personality for that perhaps and his comical tryst with the DRS made him further unpopular as he would often make bizarre reviews against seemingly plumb LBW calls. But all the jokes apart, the fact is that he was a gun player for Australia in white-ball cricket, a real giant who could have done even better if he had better fitness. Post retirement, Watson has been having a gala time in the T20 leagues across the globe. <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> Watson made a grand entry into the IPL with a stellar opening season in 2008 for Rajasthan Royals. Not only was he the leading run-scorer for the side, he was also the third highest-wicket taker and played a crucial role in the Royals' success story. He missed the next season due to national duties and injury but continued to take part in the tournament from 2010. It was only from 2013 that he was fully into the IPL as he was a part of the Australian setup. He yet again topped the batting charts for the Royals in IPK-5 and also made his maiden IPL hundred, 101 against CSK. <br/>  <br/> The all-rounder led the Royals in 2014 but had a modest outing by his standards. He was back among the runs in 2015, but had to battle injuries and missed a few games. However, he went to make an unbeaten 104 against Kolkata Knight Riders that season. The Royals' two-year ban for the spot-fixing scandal meant Watson went into the auction pool and Royal Challengers Bangalore picked him up for 9.5 crore. Somehow, he couldn't justify his potential at RCB. While he picked as many as 20 wickets in 2016, he had a poor time with the bat and was not even a regular member of the team next season. This meant RCB released him and the returning Royals did not want to retain him as well. <br/>  <br/> CSK pouched him at the auctions and Watson stunned everyone with his blitz when the tournament began. He silenced critics who were opining that he didn't have the mettle to still be part of the IPL caravan by smashing a really handsome 555 runs in the season - his best in IPL history. While he was batting mostly in the middle-order at RCB, Dhoni gave the luxury of opening the batting and the Australian was in full flow and even tonked a couple of hundreds in the season. <br/>  <br/> His knock in the IPL final against Sunrisers Hyderabad was unbelievable to watch. He struggled to put bat on ball and failed to open his account after ten balls in a chase of 179. But, in a brilliant batting display, he completed a hundred in the next 40 balls to become the fourth player to score two-plus hundreds in IPL. The innings ensured that the Super Kings coasted to victory on their comeback. The 2019 season was underwhelming for Watson who still got backed throughout the tournament and his big-game abilities came to the fore in the final where he nearly repeated his 2018 heroics, with CSK falling just short.",

      "bio": "One fine day, Rodney Marsh received a phone call from Dennis Lillee, who spoke to him about an exciting prospect, a 17-year-old left-arm fast bowler from Queensland - Mitchell Guy Johnson. Over the years, Mitch has come a long way and is now one of the key weapons of the Aussie pace bowling department.  <br/>  <br/> Johnson's stock delivery for right-handers is the one that moves away at an awkward angle. His ability to extract extra bounce on any given wicket adds to his armoury against the left-handers while he also tries to cramp them by bringing the ball back in. The top-order batsmen from the sub-continent have often succumbed to the magic of this 'once in a lifetime prospect' (as termed by Dennis Lillee).  <br/>  <br/> Though often criticised for his waywardness, Johnson still remains one of the best left-arm bowlers in the modern era, more so because of his ability to cover up his weakness by bowling those unplayable deliveries. Johnson was a part of the Australian squad during The 2006 Ashes but never featured in the playing XI. However, when the opportunity knocked his doors, he welcomed it with a red carpet. Taking 4/96 in his debut game against Sri Lanka, Johnson showed glimpses of things to come.  <br/>  <br/> Whenever you set out for a battle, an extra bullet or the extra sword always helps. That's where Johnson's batting ability comes into the picture. The tall Queenslander has the ability to play most of the orthodox shots in the book and his aggressive approach to the game makes him a handy lower-order batsman. He has certainly helped Australia overcome tough situations.  <br/>  <br/> Johnson burst onto the ODI scene by taking 4/11 against a strong Indian batting line-up. Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh were among his victims. In the 2007 ODI series in India, Johnson was the highest wicket-taker and played a key role in winning the series for his team.  <br/>  <br/> Mitchell has always relished playing against the Proteas. When South Africa toured Australia in the latter half of 2008, Johnson starred in the second Test by taking 8/61. He also scored a handy 64 batting with Clarke later in the same series. In 2009, when the Aussies travelled to South Africa, Johnson scored an unbeaten 96 which included a 26-run over off Paul Harris. It didn't end there, when the Aussies were staring down the barrel in the third Test, Mitch scored a breathtaking 123 not out, batting with the tail-enders. Johnson was named, the Man of the Series for his scintillating performances.  <br/>  <br/> Johnson's magic started to dwindle in 2009, particularly during The Ashes, where he struggled to pick wickets. He was criticised severely but managed to hold on to his place in the squad. He slowly started to regain the lost touch with notable performances against the West Indies and Pakistan in the same year. In 2011, Johnson, who was dropped for the second Ashes Test, following a poor outing in the first Test, was recalled for the third game and he ended up being the highest wicket-taker for Australia in the series.  <br/>  <br/> Johnson had an up and down 2013. Before the third Test against India in March 2013, Australia dropped him, along with James Pattinson, Shane Watson and Usman Khawaja following a breach of discipline. After that he was subsequently dropped for the Ashes in 2013. But he did well in the sixth edition of the IPL for Mumbai, providing them early breakthroughs. He troubled most batsmen with his pace and bounce and looked the Johnson of old.  <br/>  <br/> For such performances, he was selected for the ODI series against England, where he carried on his good form. He consistently bowled over 90mph and got his line and length right. He had another good tour of India, where he troubled Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina with some hostile fast bowling. Due to these efforts he was called back before the final ODI in Bengaluru to prepare for the Ashes Down Under. That decision raised quite a few eyebrows from ex-Australian cricketers since the series was level at 2-2 and it was basically a final.  <br/>  <br/> In The Ashes series in 2013-14, he emerged as the highest wicket-taker, taking 37 wickets from five matches at a mean average of 13.97, which included three five-wicket hauls. He was at his menacing best all through the series as he troubled the English batsmen with his pace and bounce. He continued his exploits with the ball in an away series against the No.1 ranked Test side South Africa, where he was the highest wicket-taker in the Test series, which Australia won 2-1, claiming 22 wickets at 17.36 apiece. He also bowled the most overs - 126.1 - across three innings.  <br/>  <br/> He was not retained by his previous team, Mumbai and in the IPL auctions in February 2014, he was snapped up by Punjab for a whopping amount of Rs 6.5 crores. Johnson continued to trouble batsmen with his raw pace and the Australian team management rested him for a few games to keep him fresh. In the 2014-15 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, after being sledged by Rohit Sharma, he smashed a crucial 88 in Brisbane in the second Test to help Australia gain a healthy first innings lead. He also picked up four wickets in the second innings to derail India. However, a hamstring injury forced him to sit out of the final Test in Sydney and he also missed a few games of the tri-series involving Australia, India and England, in the build-up to the 2015 World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Johnson picked up 15 wickets in the 2015 World Cup but he played second fiddle to Mitchell Starc, who proved to be Australia's best bowler in the tournament. His best figures came against Afghanistan, as he ripped through their top-order picking up 4 for 22. Johnson is also well known for his batting in the death overs. He proved his mettle against India in the semi-final, hitting 27 off just 9 deliveries and pushed Australia past the 300-mark.  <br/>  <br/> Even though, Johnson had his share of fine performances in the 2015 Ashes, he struggled for consistency. When Australia squared up against New Zealand at home, Johnson looked a pale shadow of his former self at two of his favourite hunting grounds - the Gabba and the WACA - and that perhaps led to him announcing his retirement from international cricket on Day 5 of the WACA Test. It was a decision that took cricket fans and experts by surprise. Johnson though, had the consolation of going past Brett Lee and becoming the fourth highest wicket-taker in Tests for Australia.  <br/>  <br/> It can be argued that the tragic PhIl Hughes incident did have an effect on Johnson, particularly in red-ball cricket where he somehow didn't appear the threat he used to be. By his own admission, Johnson revealed how he used to feel tacky on trying bouncers to batsmen. Nevertheless, post-retirement, he has been having a gala time in franchise T20 Leagues, bowing as fast and furious as he ever had before. The sensational spell of 3/3 off his four overs in the 2017 BBL semifinal and a pivotal last over in IPL final that followed have shown the world that he still has the fire in his belly. Both those teams went on to win the respective T20 leagues which makes these moments sweeter for Mitch.  These performances make one feel that perhaps, his decision to retire from international cricket was more emotional than logical.  <br/>  <br/> <b>By Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "A late bloomer to international cricket, Mike Hussey was one of the pillars of Australia's batting during their transition phase post Waugh era. Although not as attractive as left-handed batsmen generally are, Hussey's batting was a sight to behold, determination and mental strength combining beautifully with tremendous fighting spirit. Amidst all this, he did have a few signature strokes too which were a visual treat. Like his cover drive or pull/cut strokes which he dished out with utter disdain. While his batting template was destined to work for limited-overs cricket, it's his Test achievements that defined Hussey as the batsman more through his career. In ODIs, he was definitely the rightful successor to Michael Bevan as far as Australian cricket is concerned in terms of controlling the back end of the innings and at times, even the early crisis. <br/>  <br/> For all that Hussey achieved, his career almost never took off at one stage. He was racking up the runs in the domestic circuit and it was only after a slog of over 10 years that he managed to get a national call-up. The fact that Australia's batting stocks were very rich didn't help either and was a reason for his delayed initiation to international cricket. However, there was merit in debuting late and Hussey's success can be attributed to that fact. He had a wealth of experience by the time he represented Australia and was extremely sure of his game, something that young players struggle with early on in their careers. Hussey as a person was calmness personified but his entry to international cricket was anything but that. He stormed the arena in 2004, often difficult to dislodge even in the aggressive ODI format and that success rubbed off in Tests as well.  <br/>  <br/> Hussey's concentration levels were one of his biggest strengths, it was almost impossible to distract him once he got set and inevitably, he notched up big scores. A fine accumulator with a proactive mindset, he knew exactly when to rein himself in and when to go on the offensive. After a nearly flawless 3-4 years, there was a dip which was only expected, given the phenomenal levels that he had been operating at till then. The 2008-09 season was difficult but he came back a stronger batsman, ironing out the flaws that were haunting. There was also a talk regarding whether he would be able to adapt to the newest format - T20 but all that changed in 2010 and how! In a crunch game, World T20 semifinal, Hussey nonchalantly blasted Saeed Ajmal for 18 in the last over to take Australia into the finals for the first time ever. A resounding statement had been made by 'Mr.Cricket.'  <br/>  <br/> It seemed like Hussey was reinventing himself for a final dash of glory but that never came as he announced his retirement suddenly in late 2012. It definitely came as a shock to the cricketing fraternity. It was around the same time that Australia also lost Ricky Ponting and the twin blows did hurt Australia a lot. Hussey continued to be active in franchise T20 leagues having notable success in the IPL with the Chennai Super Kings and in the BBL where he signed off by leading the Sydney Thunder to a title win. That was Hussey's final year in any form of the game and he has worked as a TV commentator after his international retirement apart from also being a batting consultant. Very few players could pace the innings as well as Hussey could, be it in Tests or limited-overs cricket and it's his immaculate brain that gave him the nickname 'Mr.Cricket'.  <br/>  <br/> <b>By Hariprasad Sadanandan</b> <br/> ",

      "bio": "It won't be wrong to define Josh Hazlewood as the modern day adaptation of the legendary Glenn McGrath. The similarity isn't hard to make out - smooth run up to the crease with the intention being accuracy more than raw pace. The agenda would more often than not be an unerring fourth or fifth stump line with a bit of swing or seam to boot. Almost the classical fast bowler. Although not in the league of McGrath yet, there is no doubt that Hazlewood would be among the best pacers to have graced the game by the time he hangs up his boots. <br/>  <br/> Such was Hazlewood's talent from his early years that he landed a First-class debut at the age of 17 in the 2008-09 season, making him the youngest fast bowler ever to play for New South Wales. Gradually, he got initiated into the other formats in the domestic circuit and also got a surprise ODI debut in 2010 although it took another three years for him to play another 50-over game. Being young and raw, <br/>  <br/> Hazlewood clearly was a work in progress but the selectors were keeping an eye on him. A strong 2013-14 home season saw him come of age and it was only a matter of time before he took international cricket by storm. <br/>  <br/> Hazlewood debuted in Tests during the 2014-15 home series against India and started with a bang - a fifer on debut at the Gabba. It was a trailer of what was to come as he climbed up the ladder steadily to become one half of Australia's lethal new-ball attack along with Mitchell Starc. If his partner was a devastating left-arm pacer who relied a lot on speed through the air, Hazlewood's mantra was to stick to the basics of line and length. The policy worked for him and complemented Starc beautifully too. <br/>  <br/> With Starc being injury prone, Hazlewood had to shoulder a lot of extra responsibility at times and he showed that he relished the baggage. While showing his skills at home and also overseas on seamer-friendly conditions, Hazlewood also bowled with a lot of heart in the sub-continent, making ample use of reverse swing along with his accuracy to trouble batsmen. The 2015 Ashes series was an aberration for him as he couldn't quite make use of pitches that had movement in them. Having said that, the first tour of England for any visiting fast bowler is a challenge and to be fair to Hazlewood, he was still a rookie in international cricket. <br/>  <br/> Hazlewood shone in the 2017-18 Ashes campaign at home as the Aussies regained the urn after five years. Apart from being a successful Test bowler, Hazlewood did well in ODIs as well. His unrelenting accuracy has stifled a lot of batsmen and he has also tried to add up a few variations up his sleeve to suit the format. Although pace isn't exactly his strength, the 2017-18 season saw Hazlewood improve his speeds considerably, clocking around 87-88 mph on an average quite consistently. While the pace improved, the accuracy stayed and meant that Hazlewood's efficiency had doubled. <br/> However, there was a setback of some sorts as Hazlewood was overlooked for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. In Test cricket, he remained a strong resource with his nagging lines and ability to move the ball but struggled to nail down his spot in Australia’s limited overs setup. Brushing the disappointment of the World Cup aside, Hazlewood turned up for the 2019 Ashes and had a great campaign. He picked up 20 wickets from 4 games at an average of 21.85.  <br/>  <br/> Hazlewood eventually found his way back into Australia’s white-ball plans and was included in their squad for the 2021 T20 World Cup after an impressive run in the BBL. He had an excellent tournament, one which Australia went on to win, as he picked up 11 wickets from 7 games. In 2022, he was bought by the Royal Challengers Bangalore for the IPL. He retained his spot for the following 2022 T20 World Cup but didn’t have a notable tournament. Although initially a part of Australia’s squad for the World Test Championship Final, he was withdrawn due to injury. He went on to play the following Ashes series and picked up 16 wickets in 4 games.  <br/>  <br/> Hazlewood was named in Australia’s squad for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL Through the Years</b> <br/> For the first few years of his career, Josh Hazlewood was viewed as a red ball specialist, but he soon morphed that perception with quality performances in limited overs cricket as well. He was picked by Chennai Super Kings in 2020, who used him very effectively as a first change middle overs bowler who could keep things economical. Hazlewood improved his T20 game with his experience at CSK, developing a solid knuckle ball and perfecting the off cutters. He was let go by Chennai ahead of the mega auctions, and went over to Royal Challengers Bangalore where he had two good seasons as well. Hazlewood didn’t play the 2024 IPL season due to injury, and at the next mega auction found his way back to RCB for IPL 2025.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>,  <b>Kumar Abhisekh Das</b> & <b>Anurag Hegde</b>",

      "bio": "Aaron James Finch is an aggressive top-order batsman, who plays for Victoria. Known for his hard-hitting and ability to finish matches, Finch earned his spot in Australia's Under-19 team for the World Cup in 2006. Though he started out as a middle-order batsman, Finch was used as a floater and batted up the order when necessary for his club side. His best season came in 2009, when he impressed in the T20 Big Bash tournament.  <br/>  <br/> The season saw him scoring his maiden First-Class century when he scored 102 against Tasmania. He sealed his spot in Victoria Bushrangers' middle-order and starred in their title win. His performance in the season earned him a spot in the Rajasthan IPL franchise, where he got just one game.  <br/>  <br/> Finch's reputation as a power-hitter grew in the Champions League T20 tournament in South Africa in 2010. He smashed 41 off just 17 balls against eventual champions Chennai and also scored a match-winning fifty, later on in the tournament. The performance helped him win a contract with Delhi for the 2011 IPL season, where he was picked for US 300,000.  <br/>  <br/> Finch also represented Australia in two T20I matches against the visiting English team in 2011. He justified his selection with a blistering 53 off 33 balls at the MCG in his second game to bag the Man of the Match award and also helped Australia square the series.  <br/>  <br/> He then started to score consistently and nowadays, he is almost a certainty in Australia's limited overs sides. Finch grabbed eye-balls in 2013 when he smashed England all over the park in a T20I on his way to a sensational 63-ball 156, the highest individual score in that format. He continued his good form and scored heavily in the shortest format, forming a formidable opening combination with David Warner. He also played the 2014 World T20 and did fairly well.  <br/>  <br/> The right-hander, got his first opportunity in the ODI format in early 2013 against Sri Lanka and has been a regular member of the side since then. He also scored a couple of fifties in India before notching up two hundreds against England after The 2013-14 Ashes series.  <br/>  <br/> Finch had a good tri-series in Zimbabwe, scoring two fifties and a hundred. Although, he failed to do well against Pakistan in UAE, he improved his game for the home ODI series against South Africa, where he was against amongst the runs once again. Eventually, a healthy average of close to 40 gave him a place in Australia's squad for the 2015 World Cup. <br/>  <br/> Finch was a part of the Mumbai Indians squad in the 2015 IPL. However, he was ruled out of the tournament after tearing his left hamstring. <br/>  <br/> <b>Interesting fact:</b> Finch was banned from the national academy in 2007 for not keeping his room clean. <br/>  <br/> Post recovery, Finch had a great ODI tour in England in which he pummeled 2 fifties in 3 games. Surprisingly, Australia played only one T20I in 2015 in which Finch (the then Australian T20I skipper) didn't feature citing a hamstring injury. He did impress in the home series (ODIs and T20Is) against India but yet again pulled his hammy during the second T20I only to be ruled out of the tournament. To aggravate matters, Finch was axed as Australia's T20I captain weeks before the mega event (Icc World T20 2016). Although the Victorian recovered in time and came in as the number one T20I batsman, he struggled to find a spot in the playing XI for the first 2 games. Australian team management faced severe criticism for dropping such a quality opening batsman. Finch, however, was the part of the final 2 games in which he couldn't make much impact. Eventually, Australia failed to claim a spot in the semis. <br/>  <br/> 2018 was a massive year for Finch as he ended up getting the limited-overs captaincy of the Australian team and also got his Test debut. With Steve Smith and David Warner serving bans, a change was inevitable and although Test skipper Tim Paine got the opportunity initially, it was obvious that the Aussies needed a captain who would merit a place in the XI, something Paine didn't. <br/>  <br/> Finch endured a form slump from late 2018 onward and with Australia also having a miserable year, things were getting complicated for the team as well as their captain. However, successive series wins over India and Pakistan, both in sub-continental conditions saw Finch's stocks as a captain shoot up. His personal form also improved drastically and with Warner-Smith back, Finch led a reasonably strong Australian side in the 2019 World Cup. <br/>  <br/> Finchy continued to be one of the valuable players going around in the shortest format of the game. He featured in as many as 8 IPL teams and has also played for the San Francisco Unicorns in Major League Cricket. At home, Finch represented the Melbourne Renegades in the BBL from the 2011/12 season all the way up till his retirement in the 2023/24 season.  <br/>  <br/> In 2021, Finch led Australia to their maiden T20 World Cup title. In the tournament that was held on their home soil, Australia pipped New Zealand to clinch the trophy. He continued to lead Australia in the 2022 T20 World Cup campaign where Australia failed to defend their title. Finch announced his retirement from ODIs in 2022 and went to retire from international cricket altogether in 2023.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Cricbuzz staff</b>",

      "bio": "Born on November 20, 1987, Nathan Lyon began his career as a member of the ground-staff team at the Adelaide Oval after finishing a 4-year apprenticeship at the Manuka Oval in Canberra.  <br/>  <br/> His off-breaks caught the eyes of South Australia's Big Bash coach, Darren Berry and was recruited into the Redbacks T20 team in 2010-11. After impressing in the T20's, Lyon went on to represent South Australia in the Sheffield Shield and the domestic one day competition. His fast rise saw him get selected for the 'A' tour of Zimbabwe in 2011 where he finished with 11 wickets in the tri-series to earn the Man of the Series award.  <br/>  <br/> His efforts at the domestic and the 'A' levels did not go unnoticed. Australia were looking for a spinner since the retirement of Shane Warne and Lyon found himself touring with the national squad for the 3-test series against Sri Lanka. A classical off-spinner who loves to flight the ball, Lyon found immediate success and claimed a 5-wicket haul on his debut at Galle thus becoming the 131st player to do so. His returns were modest in the remaining part of the tour, but Lyon had shown that he is a long term prospect in the Australian tour.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Interesting fact:</b> When he dismissed Kumar Sangakkara with his 1st ball in international cricket, Lyon became the 14th bowler and 2nd Australian to take a wicket with the very 1st ball of an international career. He finished with 5/34 in the first innings, becoming the 131st player to take five wickets on debut in a Test match. <br/>  <br/> Lyon played his first test in Australia at the Gabba against New Zealand in the first Test match of the series. Lyon took 4/69 in the first innings and 3/19 in his second innings resulting in match figures of 7/88, which is the best Test match bowling figures by an Australian off-spinner at the venue. <br/>  <br/> In April 2013, Lyon was named as the only spinner for the 2013 Ashes in England. It held true until hours before the first Test when he was dropped out of the line-up in favour of Ashton Agar. However, he was recalled to the team for the Third Ashes Test, and in the Fourth Test at Chester-le-Street, he took figures of 4/42 on the first day and reduced England to 238 in their first innings. <br/>  <br/> He cemented his place in the side by the end of the 2013 Ashes series and skipper Michael Clarke couldn't ignore him for any of the Tests in the return Ashes series Down Under. He gave tremendous support to the fast bowlers trio of Ryan Harris, Mitchell Johnson and Peter Siddle by maintaining tight lines. He was Clarke's go-to man when he needed to stem the run flow. When the seamer's were not able to get the breakthrough, Lyon put his hand up and broke a number of crucial partnerships. He ended up with 19 wickets in the series which meant he had booked a seat on the flight to South Africa. Lyon bagged 8 wickets in the 3-match series and again played a crucial part and helped his side win a hard fought series 2-1. <br/>  <br/> While team was on national duty to play limited overs cricket. Lyon rolls his arms over in the domestic circuit as the selectors want him purely as a Test bowler. He represented the Sydney Sixers in the 2013/14 Big Bash League and did fairly well. <br/>  <br/> <i>\"Nathan Lyon works very hard on his bowling. He's the best off-spinner Australia has ever produced.\" </i>- lauded Shane Warne as the offie continued to pick wickets even in pacer-friendly tracks. Such is Lyon's class and consistency. He consumed scalps in the 2015 Ashes but was overlooked for the shorter version of game. He had a terrific 2015-16 home summer and was drafted into the side for the 5-match ODI series against India. Lyon was mediocre during that series and was yet again denied a ticket for the 2016 World T20. After Australia's exit from the mega event, cricket purists affirmed that Nathan Lyon would have been an impact player had he been part of the squad. Lyon though continues to be one of the senior members of the Australian Test side till date.  <br/>  <br/> Lyon put himself in the history books after he became only the 8th bowler to scalp 500 test wickets.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Pradeep Krishnamurthy and Raju Peethala</b>",

      "bio": "Ricky Ponting's injury at Sydney in 2011, opened the doors for the first Muslim cricketer to represent Australia at the highest level. A qualified pilot, the highs of this achievement were unparalleled. Having moved to Australia as a kid, Usman Khawaja with the bat in his hands was identified pretty early as the boy wonder.  <br/>  <br/> Honing his skills at the Valley District Cricket Club, Usman made it to the Australian under-19 squad for the 2006 World Cup. He featured in 4 games and hunted down 140 runs making an impression with his poise at the crease and crafty technique. A backlift which comes down on the ball like butter on bread, Khawaja loves to cut and pull.  <br/>  <br/> Following his debut series,  Usman travelled to Sri Lanka and South Africa without much of a success. The year of 2011 ended with a home series against the Kiwis and that also remained a low key affair for the then New batsman.  <br/>  <br/> He was dropped post that and his next tryst with the baggy green happened during the Ashes in England in 2013 after a layoff of almost 18 months. In 3 Tests, he managed only fifty and another exile from Test cricket was handed out.  <br/>  <br/> In the meanwhile, Usman had made his ODI debut at the beginning of 2013 and met a similar fate as he was dropped after three unsuccessful outings in colored clothing. Another big move that Usman had made was the move from NSW to Queensland in 2012. <br/>  <br/> His debut season at Queensland yielded 438 runs from 6 games and it got better in the succeeding season as he riled up 551 runs at an average of 50.09 in 8 games. But then occurred a career-threatening injury. He tore his ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) on his left knee and was out of cricket for the next 9 months.  <br/>  <br/> Khawaja who was now aware and accustomed to the waiting game built on his patience on the sidelines. He returned to the 2015-16 season with a bang. A ton on his return game for Sydney Thunder in December 2015 made the world aware of the destruction that he can be. The T20I debut was just a mere formal announcement when the touring Indians whitewashed Australia 0-3. <br/>  <br/> All this was just before his Test comeback. Usman went onto become a permanent member of the Test team post that barring the tour to India for which he was dropped unceremoniously. But he returned for the Ashes 2017-18 and scored vital knocks over the course of the series. His couple of tons in BBL 05 ensured Sydney Thunder,  the constant wooden Spooner shocked the cricketing fraternity and ended up winning the title.  <br/>  <br/> With the bans of Steve Smith and David Warner in 2018, Khawaja was thrust with the responsibility of being Australia's premier batsman in Tests and he rose to the responsibility with elan. A marathon match-saving knock in UAE was the start of a dream run for the stylish left-hander who also stamped his class during the limited-overs tour of India in 2019. <br/>  <br/> His prolific run in that ODI series and the succeeding one against Pakistan in the UAE helped Khawaja book his maiden World Cup call-up in 2019. A hamstring injury early in the tournament, however, cut his campaign short. He recovered in time for the following Ashes series but a poor run of form saw him dropped from the side and it wouldn't be until 2022 that he'd make a comeback to the international setup.  <br/>  <br/> After a 3-year hiatus, Khawaja returned to the Test side for the 4th Ashes Test in 2021/22 and he made a strong statement after scoring twin-centuries. He followed that up with another excellent performance in Pakistan and ended as the leading run-scorer. Khawaja proved his worth once again as he finished the highly-anticipated 2023 Ashes in England as the leading run-scorer. His contributions at the top of the order were vital in helping Australia retain the Ashes after drawing the series 2-2.  <br/>  <br/> In T20s, Khawaja had a brief stint in the IPL in 2016 with the now defunct Rising Pune Supergiants. He also played a few games for the Islamabad United in the PSL and represented the Sydney Thunder in the BBL until 2022. For the 2023 season, he was signed by the Brisbane Heat and named their captain despite his slim availability due to international duties.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Interesting facts:</b> Apart from being a professional cricketer, Khawaja is also a qualified pilot. <br/>  <br/> Usman is an ex-student of Westfields Sports School, which has also produced sportsmen of the calibre of Michael Clarke (former Australia captain), soccer player Harry Kewell and world champion discus thrower Dani Samuels. <br/>  <br/> <b>By Cricbuzz Staff</b>",

      "bio": "Since Michael Hussey's retirement, Australia have struggled to find a reliable middle order batsman who can both anchor and finish an innings. There have been a few who have auditioned for the spot, some with brief success as well but the consistency hasn't been there for a longer duration. Travis Head is touted to be capable of being that man and there is a feeling that he can emerge as one of the country's finest middle-order batsmen in limited-overs cricket. His ticket to international fame in the 2015-16 BBL season when he smoked a century to take the Adelaide Strikers to a victory from out of nowhere against the Sydney Sixers. An international debut followed within weeks as he was picked for the T20I series against India at home. <br/>  <br/> Head wasn't picked for the 2016 World T20 but since then, managed to be in the selectors' plans. In 50-overs cricket, Head started to become a vital cog of the Australian side. He has donned multiple roles with the bat - mostly batting in the middle order but also opened the innings in early 2017 as a part of the management's plan for the Champions Trophy that was to be held later that year. His debut as an opener saw him cracking a century and also being involved in a historical opening stand with David Warner who also got past the three-figure mark. That experiment didn't last long though and Head started getting back to his middle order routine, used mostly as a floater. Head however lost out on batting form in the 50-over format and was ignored for the 2019 WC as others in the form of Shaun Marsh and Marcus Stoinis were preferred over him. <br/>  <br/> But the ball tampering saga opened the doors of Test cricket for the southpaw. He was picked for the tour to the UAE and featured in the couple of Tests. He started off with a duck in his maiden innings but got things back on track in the second innings by scoring a fifty and also playing a pivotal role in ensuring Australia drew that Test in Dubai. <br/>  <br/> The following Test series was against India and Head started off with a classy fifty in the first Test at Adelaide. But despite getting off to starts in every knock in that series, Head could muster only two fifties. Then Sri Lanka toured down under and Head came to the party with scores of 84, 161 and 59* in the series to ensure he booked a berth in the middle order for Ashes 2019. He continued to be a regular member of Australia across formats and consolidated his place with good performances.  <br/>  <br/> He had a breakout home Ashes series in 2021-22 where he was adjudged the Player of the Series for his 357 runs including two centuries. He was also instrumental in Australia’s World Test Championship win over India. His 163 complemented by Steve Smith’s 121 setup a massive 209-run victory for Australia at The Oval.  <br/>  <br/> Aaron Finch’s retirement left an opener’s spot up for grabs and Travis Head got another opportunity at the top of the order. This time around he made it his own with solid performances and was named in Australia’s squad for the 2023 World Cup as an opener. However, an injury he sustained in a series against South Africa just before the tournament put his participation in jeopardy. Head remained in Australia's squad despite the injury and missed large parts of it. However, he had a profound impact once he returned to the XI in the latter stages and played an instrumental role in Australia's 6th World Cup triumph.  <br/>  <br/> Since his First-class debut in 2011, Head had been a talked about name in the Australian domestic circuit. A pleasant stroke maker who also has incredible power in his shots, his biggest quality is his ability to pace an innings. Head kept scoring runs in the Sheffield Shield and also in the Matador Cup across seasons to make the selectors take notice of him. While he was always in their radar, Head knew that he had to push the envelope to fast track his spike in his career and that happened to his century in the 2015-16 BBL season. Since then, he hasn't looked back. Head's off-spin is more than handy and he operates cleverly, often disrupting the batsmen's rhythm. He has donned the fifth bowler's duties quite often for Australia and is now considered a dependable option in that department. Head is also an excellent fielder to go with his other credentials and this makes him an excellent package for white-ball cricket. <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL Through the Years</b> <br/>  <br/> In the 2016 and 2017 seasons, Travis Head was part of the Royal Challengers Bangalore franchise. He had largely forgettable seasons, playing just 10 times across two seasons and getting a solitary fifty in those times. Head was released after 2017 and wasn’t in the reckoning for the IPL for many years. He gained some renewed interest post his 2023 World Cup final heroics, and he was roped in by Sunrisers Hyderabad. In 2024, he formed a lethal combination with Abhishek Sharma. They gave their franchise attacking starts as the duo once chased down a target of 167 against LSG in under 10 overs. Head also scored a quickfire hundred in a game against RCB where his franchise amassed the highest team total ever in IPL - 287. He was retained by the franchise ahead of the 2025 IPL Auctions.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>, <b>Kumar Abhisekh Das</b> & <b>Anurag Hegde</b>",

      "bio": "Every bit as quirky and idiosyncratic as his close mate and role model Steve Smith and yet just as placid at the crease, Marnus Labuschagne has quickly established himself as a mainstay in Australia’s middle order. For teams playing against Australia, it’s a tireless task - you get Smith out, well here’s another one of him, only it’s Marnus Labuschange. Labuschagne was born in Klerksdorp, a relatively obscure city in South Africa. He moved to Australia with his father in 2004, when he was 10, after his Dad had secured a job in the mining business. He grew up speaking Afrikaans, which was his mother tongue, and learned English after he started attending school in Brisbane. <br/>  <br/> He pursued cricket in school and attended the Australian Institute of sport, and went on to be selected in the Queensland U-15 side, and subsequently the U-17 and U-19 sides, on account of his consistent performances with the bat in junior cricket. <br/>  <br/> Labuschagne made his first-class debut at the historic Adelaide Oval in the 2014-15 Shieffield Shield as a 20-year-old and became an immediate benefactor for his team, scoring 83 in his first innings. His debut innings was one beyond his age given that he watched Chadd Sayers take a hat-trick from the non-striker's end, and rebuilt the innings with a 99-run fourth wicket stand with Nick Stevens, setting the base for the middle-order to score 443 runs. Although Queensland went on to lose the game and Labuschagne made a duck in the second innings, his contribution under pressure in the first innings was noted by the selectors, and he has remained a member of the side for the last 4 seasons. <br/>  <br/> He continued to grow as a batsman, stroking his way to two centuries in the Sheffield Shield in the 2015-16 season. He did have an off-season, and his average does not reflect his potential as a player, but with an upwards performance graph, a number of accolades, and an air-tight technique of a classical opener, he is looking all set to scale new heights in the upcoming season and seal his spot for the Queensland Bulls. <br/>  <br/> He has strong credentials in the limited overs format as well, having scored 271 runs at an average of 45 in the 2016-17 Matador BBQs One-Day Cup, and was declared Player of the Tournament for his batting performances. He was lauded by experts for scoring at a commendable strike-rate (90.63 in the Matador cup) despite limiting himself to orthodox shots. <br/>  <br/> His performance in the Matador Cup earned him a contract with Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash League in November 2016. He has struggled to find a place in the regular XI, scoring just 21 in his three games, and he will be looking to cement his spot in the XI during the course of 2017-18 edition of the tournament. <br/>  <br/> He had the honour of rubbing shoulders with the Australian Cricket Team when he came in as a substitute fielder in the Gabba Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2014 against India. He made a useful contribution as he took a close-in catch off the bowling of Nathan Lyon to dismiss Indian tail-ender Varun Aaron. The catch was trending on social media at the time and a video of him showed up on practicing close-in catching - wait for it - with a piece of corn! <br/> In September 2017, he made headlines for the wrong reasons, when he achieved the unenviable distinction of becoming the first player to be penalized by the umpires under the fake fielding rule, less than 24 hours after its implementation, costing his team five penalty runs. <br/>  <br/> As it so happened, in the aftermath of suspension of the trio involved in the Newlands ball-tampering saga, Marnus Labuschagne was called up into a new-look Australian Test side to tour the UAE and play Pakistan in a 2-Test series. The all-rounder failed to make much of a mark with the bat, which was not all that surprising, given that he was making his Test debut in alien conditions and was clearly struggling to adapt with the bat. However, his leg-spin was a surprising revelation, as he went on to snaffle several important wickets with his enticingly consistent lengths. It is this skill that guaranteed him a spot in the Test side, as the youngster attempted to settle into a groove with his batting skills in the lower middle-order of the Australian Test team.  <br/>  <br/> Then India toured down under and Labuschagne got a game at Sydney. He did give a good account of himself in the first innings with a well crafted 38. But the game had rains taking the honours and he didn't get to bat in the second innings. But his solid show with the bat ensured he was in the side for the home series against Sri Lanka. <br/>  <br/> Labuschagne got to his maiden fifty against the touring Lankans in the first Test at Brisbane. His returns in the next Test at Canberra were nothing to write home about. But with the 2019 Ashes happening in England, Labuschagne decided to give it a try at the county circuit for the 2019 season. His returns were exemplary as he scored runs everywhere playing in various conditions. In 18 innings for Glamorgan, Labuschagne scored 5 fifties and 5 tons to lead the run-getters tally with 1114 runs. That granted him a spot in his Australia’s squad and Labuschagne got an opportunity in the most unusual of circumstances.  <br/>  <br/> He became the first ever concussion substitute on Day 5 of the second Test as he replaced Steve Smith who’d been struck on the head the previous day. ‘Like for like’ in nearly every sense of the word, Labuschagne set out to prove that he could bat like Smith as well. He scored 59 and held on to his spot in the next game with Smith still being absent and it was here that he really seemed to own the stage as he top-scored for Australia with 72 in the first innings and 80 in the second - out-scoring England’s 1st innings tally of 67 on both occasions.  <br/> Returning home for a series against Pakistan and New Zealand, Labuschagne really settled into his groove. His maiden Test ton came in the form of a 185 against Pakistan at the Gabba and he backed that up with centuries in the next two Tests as well. After making twin-fifties in the 2nd Test against New Zealand, Labuschagne struck a magnificent double-hundred at the SCG. His meteoric rise in world cricket was encapsulated in the ICC Test Batting Rankings that year in which he ascended a whopping 106 places before making it to rank 4.   <br/> Labuschagne made his ODI debut the following year in 2020 and scored his maiden ODI ton against South Africa in Potchefstroom. He wasn’t quite able to translate his red-ball consistency to the white-ball formats and struggled to be a sure-starter in Australia’s limited-overs setup.  <br/>  <br/> Originally not a part of Australia’s squad for the 2023 Cricket World Cup, Labuschagne had a remarkable turnaround. It was the concussion sub rule that once again worked in Labuschagne’s favour. Originally not part of the XI, Labuschagne ended up replacing a concussed Cameron Green in the first ODI against South Africa in September 2023. With Australia in trouble while chasing a small total, Labuschagne scored an unbeaten 80 to steer his team to victory. He backed that up with a 124 in the next game and made a strong case for his inclusion into Australia’s 15-member squad. He was subsequently part of the team that toured India for an ODI series just before the World Cup and the 138-runs he scored in the 3-match series sealed his spot for the World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Labuschagne had a fairly quiet World Cup, but performed when it mattered the most in the all important final. He scored an unbeaten fifty in the final as Australia silenced the crowds to defeat India in their own backyard.  <br/>  <br/> Barring that World Cup final though, Labuschagne has had a tepid last couple of years where he has suffered a significant dip in form. He hasn’t scored a Test century since December, 2022 and his ODI performances have been a mixed bag as well.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Rishi Roy</b>, <b>Kumar Abhisekh Das</b> & <b>Anurag Hegde</b>",

      "bio": "Born on Boxing Day 1987, the southpaw was seen as a long-standing option after the retirement of Adam Gilchrist and was termed as the heir apparent. Wade represented Tasmania in both cricket and football during his evolving years. When he was 16, Wade was diagnosed with testicular cancer and underwent two rounds of chemotherapy before being cleared of the disease. Returning to the game, Wade went on to represent Australia in the 2006 U-19 World Cup that was held in Sri Lanka.  <br/>  <br/> Wade got his breakthrough with Tasmania in the 2006-07 season during the Ford Ranger ODI series but played only one match for his state side. He realized that he was behind the pecking order with Tim Paine being the preferred first choice. Rather than playing as a specialist batsman, Wade crossed over to Victoria during the 2007-08 season and in two seasons became the preferred choice ahead of the incumbent Adam Crosthwaite.  <br/>  <br/> A couple of productive seasons with both the bat and the gloves for Victoria in both the Sheffield Shield as well as the One day format meant that Wade established himself as another option for the selectors behind Brad Haddin. His explosive style of batting was something that always worked in his favour. <br/>  <br/> His consistency won him a spot in the Australian T20 team during the tour of South Africa in late 2011. The ODI call-up was to come soon as he made his debut against India during the Commonwealth Bank Trophy series in February, 2012. He responded with a superb 67 on debut at the MCG. Wade was selected as Haddin's back-up during the Test tour of West Indies in April 2012 and made his debut after Haddin pulled out of the series owing to personal issues.  <br/>  <br/> He showed glimpses of his batting potential and ended the tour with his 1st Test ton, a free-flowing 106 in the final Test at Roseau. Wade continued to impress with his batting abilities with a powerful 102 against Sri Lanka at the SCG, but his fumbles with the gloves did not impress the critics. With Haddin returning to the game after a brief break, the pressure grew on Wade to prove that he belonged to this level.  <br/>  <br/> Wade is a regular in the Big Bash League though and has been with Melbourne Stars since 2011. However, he found no bidders in the 2014 IPL auctions after Delhi Daredevils decided not to retain any of the players for the 7th edition of the IPL. Then the retirement of Haddin saw Peter Nevill being selected as the first choice keeper and Wade missed out. In ODIs though he continued to be the preferred choice till 2017 before poor form saw being ousted from the side. Alex Carey got the nod for the 2019 WC as well.  <br/>  <br/> But some heroic performances in the first-class set up saw him getting his place back in the Test side for the 2019 Ashes as a specialist batsman with skipper Tim Paine doing the keeping duties. Wade didn't enjoy a long-run with the Test side and Alex Carey was preferred over him when Tim Paine stood down from the side.  <br/>  <br/> He continued to be a key part of Australia's T20I setup and even captained the side on numerous occasions. He was part of both of Australia's squads for the 2021 and 2022 T20 World Cup. <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Pradeep Krishnamurthy</b> and <b>Kumar Abhisekh Das</b>",

      "bio": "A right-handed batsman and a medium pacer by trade, Marcus Stoinis, is an Australian all-rounder. Powerfully built, Stoinis can torment bowling attacks and clear any boundary with ease. Capable of opening the batting, playing in the middle order or coming in to finish an innings while also providing a reliable bowling option, Stoinis has been a crucial part of Australia’s white-ball setup.  <br/>  <br/> Stoinis was a member of the Australian side that featured in the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia, a team that included players like Steven Smith, Phil Hughes, James Pattinson, Josh Hazlewood and James Faulkner. At 19 years of age, Stoinis made his debut for Western Australia in January 2009. However, he couldn't quite become a permanent fixture in the playing eleven and decided to move to Victoria for the 2012-13 season. <br/>  <br/> On the recommendation of former teammate Theo Doropoulos, he decided to play for the Northcote Cricket Club in the Victorian Premier Cricket competition. Soon, things started to change for Stoinis as he enjoyed phenomenal success at Northcote. He smashed four centuries in 2013/14, averaging a massive 100 for the season. <br/>  <br/> With the kind of form Stoinis was in, his selection in the Victorian state team was inevitable and he was soon named in Victoria's Sheffield Shield squad. He didn't disappoint the Victorian selectors one bit, scoring a magnificent 170 against Tasmania, an innings that cemented his place in the Victorian top-order. <br/> He was the top run-getter for Victoria in the 2014/15 Sheffield Shield season. He amassed 785 runs at an average of 49.06 during the summer. He was also a part of the Australian A outfit that visited India in July 2015. Stoinis, who made 77 and took 2/18 in the first four-day game against India A, was rewarded with a place in the national squad for the ODIs and the lone T20I against England in August-September 2015. <br/>  <br/> With time, he matured as a batsman, while his bowling was always handy. He opened the batting for Melbourne Stars in the 2018-19 BBL. He was a part of Australia’s 2019 World Cup squad and had a poor run with the bat, scoring 83 runs from 8 innings but had decent returns with the bal as he picked up 7 wickets. He continued to be a part of Australia’s white-ball setup in the following years and was a part of Australia’s T20 World Cup winning squad in 2021. He retained his spot in the 2022 T20 World Cup and had some impactful performances. Leading up to the 2023 Cricket World Cup, Stoinis was named in Australia’s 15-member squad. However, Stoinis' poor returns in the World Cup and his continued poor form meant that he was dropped from the ODI side in early 2024, a move as Stoinis himself claimed was \"no surprise\".  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> One of the premium qualities which isn't available in abundance in the Indian premier league is the 'bonafide all-rounders'. Marcus Stoinis belongs to that rare breed of cricketers who can bat anywhere in the batting order, bowl useful overs, both at the start and the end of a T20 innings and is a gun fielder. It is these qualities that prompted the Royal Challengers into entering a trade with the Kings XI Punjab ahead of the 2019 edition of the Indian Premier League. A late bloomer by international standards, Stoinis is a powerfully built man - who has the ability to clear any ground with his brutal hitting process. <br/>  <br/> Signed by Delhi Daredevils in 2015, he didn't feature in the franchise's plans and was later bought by Kings XI Punjab in the subsequent auctions. Although his international record was on the upward curve, it didn't really translate into significant performances for the Mohali-based outfit. Nevertheless, the promise of a big future meant that they used their right to match card to grab him off RCB's hands - despite the move costing them 6.2 crores - during the 2018 IPL auction. Another average season though meant that KXIP had reasons to off-load their prized asset - when RCB came calling once again in 2019, they were happy to trade him for homebred Mandeep Singh. <br/>  <br/> Stoinis went to play in different leagues, including for the Southern Brave in The Hundred and for the San Francisco Unicorns in the inaugural season of the MLC.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Rishi Roy</b> and <b>Anurag Hegde</b>",

      "bio": "With his boy-ish looks and a similar action, a teen-aged Adam Zampa drew immediate comparisons with Shane Warne. With the old-school technique of tossing the ball above the eye-line and wily deception, Adam Zampa burst onto the scene when he represented Australia U-19 in their successful 2010 World Cup campaign, when scouts and experts recognized the rather familiar action. <br/>  <br/> After being handed a state contract in 2012, Zampa made his first-class debut for New South Wales in the 2012/13 Sheffield Shield. He moved to South Australia for the next season and continued to perform admirably in the Sheffield Shield. After moving to South Australia, he interacted with Johan Botha, then captain of South Australia and trained at the Australian Center of Excellence before joining the squad for the summer. <br/>  <br/> After making headlines with his hat-trick in the Matador BBQs One-Day Cup, Zampa was sought after by several T20 franchises and got a transfer to the Melbourne Stars for the 2014/15 season. Zampa continued to impress with his cunning bowling in the shorter formats, but did not deliver any performances of note in Shield cricket. However, his T20 numbers, especially in the BBL, where his overall economy rate stood at a scarcely believable 7.19 – essentially conceding a miserly 28 runs in a T20 match. <br/>  <br/> He was selected into the Australian ODI and T20I squads and performed well enough to maintain his spot for the 2016 World T20 in India. Despite Australia's disappointing campaign, picking Zampa proved to be a good move as he ended the tournament as Australia's highest wicket-taker. The highlight of his bowling was, once again, his miserly economy rate, standing at 6.27 runs per over during the World T20. <br/>  <br/> Zampa continued to impress in other T20 leagues around the world, including the CPL and the Indian Premier League. The young leg-spinner seemed to have taken a liking to Indian conditions, extracting more turn on the dry pitches, as he notched up the second-best figures for any bowler in the 2016 edition of the Indian Premier League, when he claimed 6/19 against the Sunrisers Hyderabad (albeit in a losing cause). He impressed in the CPL as well, finishing with 15 wickets in the season. <br/>  <br/> Zampa was a shock omission for the T20I series against Sri Lanka at home in early 2017, owing to captain Aaron Finch's 'horses for courses' strategy. Zampa publicly expressed his dejection as a 'kick in the guts' and returned in the 3rd T20I to hand his team a consolation win and delivered a man of the match performance with figures of 3/25. <br/>  <br/> The wrist-spinner struggled to stand out in first-class cricket, owing to the strong South Australian pace attack, leaving Zampa as a bit of a side-show in Shield cricket. In the 2016/17 Sheffield Shield, he delivered his first note-worthy performance against Queensland, as he picked up 10 wickets in the match on an Adelaide track conducive to spin bowling. He was touted by ex-Kiwi skipper to play in the Test series in India in early 2017, owing to his excellent white-ball record in the country and the higher degree of possible control with the SG ball. However, the selectors gave preference to finger-spinners Steve O'Keefe and Nathan Lyon, and Zampa was unable to earn a ticket to India. <br/>  <br/> A cunning bowler with the ability to deceive batsmen in the air and off the pitch, Zampa's talent was never in doubt but for some reason, he never got the desired backing despite having a year like 2016 where he was the highest wicket-taker in ODIs. He waited patiently though and continued to work harder on improving his game and repertoire. <br/>  <br/> The 2018-19 season saw a turnaround for Zampa who had a fine BBL to begin with but it was the white-ball tour of India in 2019 that cemented his spot in the national side. It seemed like he had finally got his act together and with the management also supporting him fully, Zampa started to turn in match-winning spells that booked his ticket for the World Cup. Zampa played in just 4 games and picked up 5 wickets. In the following years, Zampa continued to be a steady presence in Australia’s white-ball setup. While performances of note were few and far between, Zampa always performed well enough to warrant a place in the squad. Subsequently, he was a part of Australia’s squads for the twin T20 World Cups of 2021 and 2022 and he was the second highest wicket-taker with 13 wickets in 7 games, including a match-winning fifer against Bangladesh. <br/>  <br/> Zampa was bought by the Rajasthan Royals for INR 1.5 crore in 2022. The following year, Zampa was named in Australia’s 15-member squad for the Cricket World Cup as their front-line spinner.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Rishi Roy</b>",

      "bio": "Mitchell Marsh is the younger brother of Australian batter Shaun Marsh and the son of Australia's former opener, Geoff Marsh. Unlike his father and elder brother, Mitchell has worked on the art of fast bowling. He classifies as a hard-hitting all-rounder who bats in the middle-order. He started playing competitive cricket at the age of 17 and plays for Western Australia in the domestic circuit. Marsh found success early in his career. He was appointed Australia’s U19 captain and he led his team to victory in the 2010 U19 World Cup. Marsh’s personal best in that series was a match-winning 97 in the semi-final against Sri Lanka. Even before he made his senior international debut, he was roped in by the IPL side Deccan Chargers in 2010. He eventually went on to play for his country against South Africa in a T20I at Wanderers in 2011. <br/>  <br/> He became a bit of a T20 agent at a very young age. He was drafted into the Pune Warriors squad in 2011 and he was with them until 2013. He also played for the Nagenahira Nagas in the Sri Lanka Premier League. Back home in Australia, he has been a regular member of the side for Perth Scorchers in the Big Bash League since its inception in 2011. <br/>  <br/> On the back of some impressive performances, the Australian selectors named Marsh in the squad for the Zimbabwe tri-series and he straightaway grabbed eyeballs in the first match of the tournament, with a breezy 89. With Shane Watson being injured, Marsh made his Test debut against Pakistan during Australia's tour to the UAE in October 2014 and he notched up a fine 87 in the Test played in Abu Dhabi. He also did well with the bat in the subsequent ODI series against South Africa and played the first two Test matches of the 2014-15 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, before walking off the field due to a hamstring injury on Day 1 of the second Test in Brisbane. He took no further part in the series, but the selectors picked him in the 2015 World Cup squad as he was expected to be back to full fitness. <br/>  <br/> Marsh didn't feature much in the tournament which Australia ended up winning. His only highlight was a 5-wicket haul against England. However, with a few retirements after the showpiece event, he got his opportunities and started performing well. He was able to weigh in with the bat in ODIs while his bowling was always handy. Despite having the tag of an all-rounder, it was obvious that Marsh was a better batter than a bowler. The year 2016 was memorable for him as he notched up his maiden ODI century in the home summer against India. <br/>  <br/> Marsh spent a lot of time on the bench, mostly due to injury rather than a lack of form. He found himself in and out of the Test setup and never really cemented his spot in the side. His maiden and career-best Test hundred came in 2017 in an Ashes game against Australia at Perth. The 2018-19 season saw Marsh being awarded a national contract but he didn’t feature in either of Australia’s sides on a regular basis. He was continually plagued by injuries, some of which he only had himself to blame for, like the time he broke his hand in 2019 after punching a wall following a dismissal in a Sheffield Shield game. <br/>  <br/> Perhaps his career defining knock came in the final of 2021 World T20. Marsh scored an unbeaten 50-ball 77 to help his side chase down 173 against trans-Tasman rivals New Zealand. In an innings that earned him the Player of the Match award, Marsh struck six boundaries and four maximums.  <br/>  <br/> Finally free of injuries, Marsh had a massive resurgence as an international cricketer and announced his return with a resounding Ashes century in the 2023 series in England. Coming in to replace an injured Cameron Green in the 3rd Test, Marsh found himself in the middle with Australia crippled at 85/4. In what was his first Test match since 2019, Marsh held no inhibitions and played his shots with freedom. His run-a-ball 118 pushed Australia to a fighting total and although Australia ended up losing that Test, Marsh demonstrated his maturity and potential.  <br/>  <br/> Marsh’s return to limited-overs cricket in his new-avatar, an opening batter, seemed to do wonders as he found some great form in both ODIs and T20Is. With some senior players being rested, Marsh was named Australia’s captain for a T20I series in South Africa and he had a successful series as both captain and batter with Australia winning the series 3-0 and him ending up as the leading run-scorer with 186 runs.  <br/>  <br/> After representing the Deccan Chargers in 2010, Marsh went on to represent another now-defunct team, Pune Warriors India, for three years. In 2016, he was bought by the Rising Pune Supergiants and played just 3 games for them. Marsh returned to the IPL after a three-year absence in 2020 after being bought by the Sunrisers Hyderabad but his campaign ended after just one game with him rolling his ankle. After nearly a year touring around in biosecure conditions induced by Covid-19, Marsh opted out of the 2021 edition due to bubble-fatigue. In 2022, Marsh was bought by the Delhi Capitals for INR 6.5 crore. <br/>  <br/> <b>By Hariprasad Sadanandan</b> and <b>Anurag Hegde</b>",

      "bio": "A well-built, hard-hitting right-hander from Queensland, Chris Lynn is one of the most accomplished batsmen in the Australian domestic circuit. His ability to take on even the best of bowlers is a big plus while he also has the knack of adapting to situations and to different formats. <br/>  <br/> Much like any contemporary cricketer, Lynn made his domestic debut first in the shortest format of the game for Queensland against New South Wales. He then moved on to List A cricket before finally getting a taste of the longest format (first-class), all in a space of 2 months and at the tender age of 19. <br/>  <br/> Although he didn't leave a lasting impression in his initial games, Lynn took his time to get into his groove in all formats and started to score big. He scored an uncharacteristic match-saving hundred for Queensland soon after, showcasing his versatility, and thereby cementing his place in his first-class side. With an average of over 40 in the first-class format, over 30 in the List-A format and close to 30 in the T20 format, Lynn is a very good candidate for national duty, if the Australian selectors were to look for replacements at the top of the order.  <br/>  <br/> In fact, impressed by his batting and fielding skills, the selectors presented him with the Australia cap for the home T20I series against England in January 2014. He wasted no time and bludgeoned a violent (albeit typical) 19-ball 33 on debut. His career, however, has been marred with injuries at unfortunate times, having injured his shoulder just before the Matador Cup in two consecutive seasons, thereby missing out on his opportunities to strengthen his credentials for the International side. This meant that he had to miss out on the Matador One-Day Cup as well as a part of the Shield season on two consecutive occasions. However, he made the most of his opportunities when he was fit, essaying a typically stroke-filled career-best 250 against Victoria in the 2014/15 Sheffield Shield season on his return from injury. <br/>  <br/> His game-changing abilities have already made him a bit of T20 legend. Back home in Australia, the Brisbane Heat franchise signed him for the inaugural edition of the Big Bash League in 2011 and that is where he became a household name. He has been the 'man of the tournament' in two seasons of the BBL. In BBL 2016/17, he was dismissed only twice and scored 309 runs at an astonishing average of 154.50 at an inconceivable strike-rate of 177.59. In the preceding season, he was the top-scorer in the BBL with 378 runs at an average of 54, and again at an unprecedented strike-rate of 173. He also holds the record for the most number of sixes in the history of the Big Bash League, and the most number of runs for the Brisbane Heat (third overall in the BBL). He clearly has some astonishing numbers in the Big Bash League, but one of the defining moments of his T20 career has been the over from Australian Test bowler Ben Hilfenhaus, in which he carted 5 sixes. <br/>  <br/> Needless to say, he was one of the most dangerous players in the Brisbane Heat batting line-up. He was also a part of the 2018 CPL in the Caribbean, but quit the tournament mid-way, returning to Australia to work on his batting in pursuit of his dream of playing the World Cup in 2019. His franchise, the Knight Riders, managed to win their second consecutive trophy anyway. Unfortunately, a spot in Australia's World Cup squad did not ensue and his struggles with fitness meant that he spent considerable time off the field. In the 2021/22 season, Lynn saw his form dwindle and hit a new low after finishing the tournament with an average of just 17.91. This prompted the Brisbane Heat from axing their once crown jewel and he joined the Adelaide Strikers.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> He was roped in by the Deccan Chargers for 4th and 5th seasons of the Indian Premier League for USD 20,000 before the Sunrisers Hyderabad signed him for the 6th season. After being released by the Hyderabad franchise, Lynn went into the auction pool for the 2014 edition and was roped in by the Kolkata Knight Riders for 1.3 crores. He immediately made an impression, pulling off a stunning (and potentially match-winning) catch to dismiss AB de Villiers at deep mid-wicket. The pivotal catch and a quickfire 45 won him the man-of-the-match award. <br/>  <br/> But a dodgy shoulder and other commitments ensured he missed most of the 2014 and 2016 editions and the entire 2015 IPL. The 2017 season saw him carting 295 runs from 7 games at an average of close to 50 which included 3 fifties. His best of 93* came against Gujarat Lions as he smashed 6 fours and 8 sixes during the knock. He went on to make several major contributions with the bat for the Kolkata franchise in the same season, most notably, a record 106-run opening partnership off 36 balls with Sunil Narine. <br/>  <br/> 2018 was the only season in which he played all the games for KKR and was awarded Man of the Match twice. A slightly restrained Lynn scored 491 runs from 16 games at a strike-rate of 130.24. After a few seasons with KKR, he was bought by the Mumbai Indians in 2020 but did not get much game-time.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Rishi Roy</b> <br/> ",

      "bio": "Cameron Green is a young prodigy who rose through the ranks through grade cricket and burst onto the domestic scene with a 5-for on debut at the age of just 17. A precocious talent, the young fast bowler became the youngest bowler to take a five-wicket haul in the history of Shield cricket. Standing at 6’6 feet tall, Green bowls a ‘heavy’ ball and isn’t afraid of doing the grunt work. Add to that his exceptional batting talent and the ability to float up and down the order and it’s quickly evident why he’s rated so highly. That’s not even mentioning his fielding abilities - often snaffling half-chances at gully and backward point by using his extensive reach.  <br/>  <br/> Green's junior days were marred with injury and he had an injury scare during his 2nd Sheffield game as well, when he managed to dislocate his knee during warm-ups. However, this was immediately taken care of by the physio at the ground and he was cleared to continue playing. <br/>  <br/> His lower-order pinch-hitting talent came to the fore when he scored a 45 in his second first-class game, biffing three monstrous sixes off Baggy Green-holder James Pattinson, and extending his team's lead from 104 to 168 while he was at the crease. In his second outing with the ball in that match, he ended with figures of 3/20, including the timely wickets of opposition skipper Cameron White and Dan Christian to earn his side an innings win for which he earned praise from his captain Adam Voges. <br/>  <br/> He made his List A debut in the tour match against Pakistan for the Cricket Australia XI and bagged 3 wickets, including that of veteran batsman Shoaib Malik, and bothered the Pakistan players with his accurate and rapid seam bowling. The prodigious teenager was handed a rookie contract by the Perth Scorchers ahead of the 2017/18 season.   <br/>  <br/> Impressive performances in the domestic circuit earned him his maiden Australia call-up for the tour to India in late 2020. He made both his ODI and Test debut in December 2020. His T20I debut came in the following year and he was named in Australia’s squad for the 2022 T20 World Cup as a replacement for an injured Josh Inglis. His maiden Test 5-fer came in the Boxing Day Test against South Africa in 2022.  <br/>  <br/> Ahead of the 2023 IPL, Cameron Green was swept up by the Mumbai Indians for a whopping sum of INR 17.5 crore and this made him the second most expensive overseas player in the history of the IPL. That same season, Green scored his maiden IPL century, a 100* against the Sunrisers Hyderabad while opening the batting. Green’s maiden Test century came just a few months later in a Test against India at Ahmedabad where he scored 114. He was also a part of the Australian team that won the World Test Championship.  <br/>  <br/> Green was named in Australia’s squad for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Rishi Roy</b> and <b>Anurag Hegde</b>",

      "bio": "One of the most explosive all-rounders of the modern era, Ben Stokes's energy is infectious on the cricket field. He is extremely passionate about everything that he does and being an aggressive character means that there is seldom a dull moment when he is around. An attacking southpaw with a penchant for the big hits while also being capable of playing a big innings, Stokes is also equally good with the ball. He can bowl at moderately high speeds and has a knack of providing breakthroughs when nothing seems to work for his team. <br/>  <br/> Born on 4 June 1991 in Christchurch, New Zealand, Benjamin Andrew Stokes is the son of rugby league player, Gerald Stokes who represented New Zealand in international Rugby Leagues. His sublime talent was clear from an early age and it was no surprise that he signed on a 2-year county contract with Durham at the age of 18. He made his one-day debut against Surrey in 2009 and marked the occasion by snaring Mark Ramprakash with his 3rd delivery in FC cricket. He played 2 youth Tests against Bangladesh and excelled with both bat and ball. His talent was further noticed in the 2010 U-19 WC where he registered a century against India. He made his FC debut in the season opener against MCC at Abu Dhabi in 2010, scoring his first fifty and picking up a wicket. <br/>  <br/> Stokes's consistent performances catapulted him into national reckoning and it was no surprise when he was named in the England ODI squad for the one-off match against Ireland and the home series against India. A broken finger meant that he could only play as a batsman. He struggled against India in the ODI series and was dropped from the subsequent away tour of India. After recuperating from the acute injury, Stokes rebounded admirably, compiling 827 runs in addition to capturing 37 wickets at an average of 21.47. His resplendent all-round heroics saw him being ear-marked as the one to eventually fulfill the all-rounder's role that had not been filled since the retirement of Freddie Flintoff. <br/>  <br/> Expectedly Stokes was named in the England Lions development squad for the Australian tour but in a cruel quirk of fate, he was sent back home along with Kent pacer, Matt Coles, for repeated breaches of discipline and unprofessional conduct. Stokes tendered his apology for his irresponsible behaviour and vowed to return to top-flight cricket. He underwent rehabilitation and then earned the third seamer's slot for the ODIs against Australia on the back of his stupendous heroics in Durham's championship winning campaign. His maiden 5-fer, albeit in a losing cause, did not miss the brains trust of the English selectors as Stokes was included in the 17-member squad for the 2013-14 return Ashes Down Under. <br/>  <br/> Stokes made his debut in the second Test and hit a brilliant maiden Test century in the third Test. Stokes bagged a six-fer in the first innings of the fifth Test and also top scored with 47 runs in the first innings to help England crawl to 155. Although England suffered a humiliating 5-0 whitewash, Stokes had a fantastic series finishing as England's second-highest wicket taker with 15 wickets and third-highest run-getter with 279 runs. <br/>  <br/> After a string of low scores and also being briefly out of England’s squad, Stokes showed his class and quality with a thrill-a-minute ton against New Zealand at Lord's in a Test match. He also was in prime form against Australia at Trent Bridge when he plucked a five-for as the hosts reclaimed the Ashes. During the tour of South Africa, Stokes played with sparkle and fizz in Cape Town to crunch the fastest double ton by an Englishman in Tests. Unfortunately, in the World T20 held in India, he was at the receiving end of Carlos Brathwaite's broad willow as he was smacked for four sixes in the last over of the final at the Eden Gardens. Stokes was shattered as West Indies clinched the title. Subsequently, Stokes sustained a knee injury while playing in a Test match against Sri Lanka in Leeds. <br/>  <br/> Despite the World T20 setback, Stokes' career has progressed in a serene fashion. Having missed out the majority of the home season with injury, he returned for the sub-continental tour of Bangladesh and India. He had mixed returns with the bat, but shone with the ball, especially with his ability to get reverse swing. A century and a five-wicket haul was a nice way for Stokes to sign off a tough 2016. A decent Champions Trophy followed, where England were eliminated in the semifinals and just when it seemed like Stokes had the world at his feet, tragedy struck. Not for the first time in his cricketing career, indiscipline hurt him bad and this time it was the biggest ever issue that he had faced. An incident in the Bristol nightclub meant that he was suspended by the ECB until further notice. It was a massive blow to England's Ashes campaign which eventually ended in a 0-4 drubbing. <br/>  <br/> <b>World Cup 2019</b> <br/>  <br/> 14th July 2019 saw Ben Stokes realising every bit of human emotion. England had taken the game into the Super Over and Ben Stokes was the one who faced the last ball with two needed. He again came out to bat during the super over and scored 8 off 3 to help England reach 15 runs in the one over eliminator. With 16 to win, New Zealand also managed 15 but lost the finale on the boundary count-back rule. England were crowned champions and Ben Stokes was awarded the Man of the Match award. Stokes also scored 5 fifties during the WC campaign and was always the man making the difference towards the end of the innings. <br/>  <br/> It couldn't get any better for Stokes when he played an astonishing unbeaten knock of 135 during the Ashes and his last wicket partnership with Jack Leach, who contributed 1 in a stand worth 76 runs as England pulled off a stunning one-wicket win over arch-rivals Australia, in a keenly contested Headingley classic - the same venue where a similar England all-round, Sir Ian Botham, had conjured up that classic 149 in the 1981 Ashes. Stokes almost replicated his heroics from his match-winning performance four years ago against Australia at Headingley. He played a swashbuckling innings of 155 at the home of cricket during the Ashes. Stokes stitched a remarkable century partnership with Broad for the 7th wicket in which the latter only contributed 11 runs. When England needed 70 runs for a win, Stokes was dismissed and he left the arena amidst a rousing reception from the crowd. England eventually fell short by 43 runs but Stokes once again gave lasting memories to his fans. Can Stokes go one past Botham and become England's folklore hero? Only time will tell. <br/>  <br/> <b>Test captaincy and Bazball </b> <br/>  <br/> After Joe Root resigned as Test captain in 2022, Stokes was elevated to the England Test captaincy and along with coach Brendon McCullum began a new revolution in Test cricket with their attacking strategy coined \\\"Bazball\\\" by the press. Since taking over the full-time captaincy, Stokes has led England to 13 wins in his 18 Tests drawing widespread praise and adulation for the way they play their cricket. <br/>  <br/> Stokes retired from ODIs in July 2022 citing the increasing demand of playing in all three formats. Stokes was Player of the Match in the 2022 ICC T20 World Cup final as England won the tournament against Pakistan. Stokes reversed his decision to retire from ODIs ahead of the 2023 50-over World Cup. After 14 months in ODI retirement, Stokes returned to the England set-up and featured in a bilateral series against New Zealand. In the third ODI at Oval, he scored a blazing 182 off 124 proving his mettle once again the format – 182 is also the highest score in the format by an Englishman. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> <b>Indian Premier League </b> <br/>  <br/> A genuine seam-bowling all-rounder who has the ability to hit big shots is a priceless commodity in the T20 format. Therefore, it wasn’t a surprise when Ben Stokes fetched earth-shattering numbers at the 2017 IPL auctions. He was picked up by the Rising Pune Supergiant and in his maiden IPL season, the charismatic Englishman showed why he was worth all the money. He was a gun bowler for RPS, particularly at the death where he executed the yorker and the other variations to good effect. With the bat too, he won a few games single-handedly including an IPL century that was ranked among the knocks of the tournament. <br/>  <br/> With over 300 runs and more than 10 wickets, Stokes’s 2017 season was terrific and was arguably the most valuable player of that season. At the fresh 2018 IPL auctions, he once again attracted smashing numbers with the Rajasthan Royals snapping him up in an extremely costly deal. However, Stokes neither got going with the bat nor with the ball and was below par in both the seasons (2018 and 2019). <br/>  <br/> In the 2021 season, Stokes suffered a finger injury which ruled him out from the entire season after playing in only one match. Stokes did not play the 2022 season as he wanted to concentrate on his national commitments. Ahead of the 2023 season, CSK shelled out INR 16.25 Crore (£1.6 million) to buy the star allrounder. Stokes only featured in the first two matches for CSK in 2023 and his performance was average. Another injury setback in the form of a toe injury kept him out for a span of around 3 weeks. He was available for selection in the final week of April but he didn’t get a match. Stokes returned to the UK after CSK’s final group game to give himself enough time to prepare for the Ashes.",

      "bio": "Joe Root, born on 30th December 1990, hails from a rich cricketing background. His grandfather captained Rotherham CC in the Yorkshire League for several seasons whilst his younger brother, Billy, is a regular with Glamorgan. In addition to being awarded a Daily Telegraph scholarship at the 2005 Bunbury festival, Root also attracted cricket scholarships at Workshop College, the school he attended, and Yorkshire Cricket academy. The gifted batsman celebrated his Yorkshire second Team debut in July 2007 with a fifty. <br/>  <br/> There was no looking back as Root's meteoric rise continued unabated. A thoroughly emphatic Man of the Series performance for England Under-19 against Bangladesh Under-19 in 2010 witnessed the 'boy wonder' land a three-year professional contract with Yorkshire. Having marked his County Championship debut at the onset of 2011, Root established himself as a reliable batsman. The big breakthrough ensued in the following season when Root cracked an undefeated 222 in the County Championship encounter against Hampshire at the Rose Bowl. <br/>  <br/> It was not long before Root's consistency earned him a Test berth as he was picked for England's historic Indian sojourn in 2012. Alastair Cook and his merry men surmounted tremendous odds to taste victory in the Test series. Among several stellar displays - Root's debut, a baptism by fire, stood out. When young Root strode out to bat in Nagpur, England were reeling at 139 for five with India's spin quartet - Ravi Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Piyush Chawla and Pragyan Ojha ruling the roost. Almost unmindful of the slow nature of the pitch that was described as one of the toughest by Kevin Pietersen, Root starred in a composed 289-minute 73, the sixth longest innings by an English batsman on debut, to steer England to a safe stalemate and in the process a series win. <br/>  <br/> In the subsequent ODI series, Root compiled four successive scores of 30 plus including his maiden half-century in the fourth ODI. Root's right-arm off-breaks also presented a more than useful bowling option to Cook. The champagne moment of Yorkshire cricket arrived when Root along with another Yorkshire-bred batsman, Jonny Bairstow, pieced together a 124-run partnership versus New Zealand to prop up England at Headingley. During the process, Root reached his maiden ton and England romped to a 247-run win. <br/>  <br/> Root was in for another stern examination, this time at the top of the order in the 2013 Ashes when he was asked to open. He responded brilliantly with a monumental 180 in the second innings of the second Test at the home of cricket, Lord's. Root's insatiable hunger for runs helped him secure a central contract following England's 3-0 drubbing of their arch-rivals. He was also at it in the Champions Trophy in 2013, hitting 173 runs, the most by an Englishman. Just before The Ashes series got underway in England, he was involved in an ugly altercation with David Warner which ended with the latter 'throwing a punch' on Root. With Michael Carberry also racking up big runs to seal the opening slot alongside Cook, Root returned to his customary No. 6 role for the return Ashes that same year. He was later promoted up the order when Jonathan Trott left the tour midway due to a stress-related illness. He failed in the entire series with only a couple of noteworthy performances to account for. <br/>  <br/> However, the selectors retained their faith in him and he was a part of England's squad to West Indies. Root did not disappoint and put up a solid display in the ODI series finishing as the highest run-getter, including his maiden ton in the fourth ODI. For his stellar performance, Root was also adjudged as the Player of the Series. Sadly, he was forced to leave the tour midway due to a broken thumb and was ruled out of the World T20 tournament in 2014. <br/>  <br/> Root went from strength-to-strength in 2014, he started the summer with an unbeaten 200 against Sri Lanka at Lord's and followed it up with two more hundreds against India. He was also a standout performer in the 50-over format and the only batsman to hold his own in the 5-2 drubbing against Sri Lanka. He was one of the first names to be penned down when the 15-member World Cup squad was picked for the 2015 edition.  <br/>  <br/> Root's stocks zoomed after a successful 2015 Ashes series against arch-rivals, Australia. Having started the series with a fluent 134 at Cardiff, an innings which helped his team gain the early advantage, he then made a superb 130 in Nottingham to help England regain the Ashes after having suffered a 5-0 hammering a year and a half ago. In all, Root made 460 runs during the series at an impressive average of 57.50. <br/>  <br/> Root had well and truly arrived and he then went on to make a career-best 254 - against Pakistan in Lord's. Root was now crowned as one of the FAB four young batsmen in the world - alongside the captains of Australia, New Zealand and India. Having played just one Test during his debut tour of India in 2012, the 2016 series was expected to be Root's biggest Test of his career. He started with a hundred, but the age old problems of not converting fifties into hundreds came back to haunt him. He made four scores of fifty plus and ended the series with 491 runs at an average of 49.10 - clearly the best England batsman on the tour in 2016. England went down in the series.  <br/>  <br/> Having become an established player for England across formats, Root took over the Test captaincy from Alastair Cook in February 2017 with the latter stepping down after a four-year stint. Root's first assignment was the home series against a probing South African outfit. He shone with the bat and also led decently as England comfortably clinched the series. West Indies were the next visitors and they were also brushed aside although they did stun the pundits by winning a Test match. Root seemed to be fairly in control tactically although it was arguable if he was as influential on the field as a captain needs to be. An away tour was the best way to analyse this part. <br/>  <br/> An Ashes campaign is a historic part of a cricketer's campaign and to have that as your first overseas assignment makes it extremely tough for any captain. Like most visiting sides in Australia, England also got a severe beating in the series and Root's captaincy was under the scanner as was his continuing inability to convert fifties into hundreds. As a batsman, he was trying his best but it was evident that he seemed helpless as a leader. Under Root, England had a successful home season in 2018 though, drawing 1-1 with Pakistan first before going on to beat India 4-1. Heading to Sri Lanka later in the year, Root became the first English captain to win a series there since 2001 with his 125-run knock sealing the second Test and the series. <br/>  <br/> Australia went on to retain the 2019 Ashes after drawing the series 2-2 despite Stokes carrying England to a fabled 1-wicket win at Headingley. Root, who batted up the order at three, a matter which in itself was heavily critiqued at the time, went through the series without a century. England recorded a significant series win in South Africa in 2019-20, coming back to win 3-1 after losing the first game - a series win that Root went on to term as his 'proudest result' as a captain. Root’s best years with the willow were still ahead of him though and England’s 2021 tour to Sri Lanka was the beginning of a vibrant purple patch. After an extended break enforced by the pandemic, England toured the island nation for a 2-match Test series and Root was at his very best. Under testing and unfamiliar conditions, Root scored a gritty 228 in the first game and followed it up with a 186 in the second game to lead England through to a series win. <br/>  <br/> Root carried his form to Indian shores as he notched up another double-hundred in the first of four Tests at Chennai in 2021 - firmly establishing himself as one of the best batters to tour the subcontinent. Despite winning the first Test however, England were handed 3-1 drubbing. While Root’s rich vein of form with the bat continued, England found themselves trailing 2-1 when India turned up for a Test series at their shores later the same year (the final Test of the 5-match series was postponed due to Covid-19). Despite Root scoring a century in each of the first three games, England seemed hapless. At a time when the rest of England’s talent-rich batting order were woefully underwhelming, Root stood as a lone-ranger, scoring a mountain of runs - including six centuries and nearly 30% of all of England’s runs that year - keeping his side afloat when otherwise they would’ve already been at the ocean floor. <br/>  <br/> It wasn’t surprising then that a listless England team suffered a heavy 4-0 defeat in the 2021-22 Ashes down-under. Calls for Root to resign as captain only grew louder and despite the management continuing to persist with him for the following tour of the West Indies, the final straw had been placed and Root decided to relinquish the captaincy after the conclusion of the tour. <br/>  <br/> With pressure of captaincy no longer his, Root had a renewed enthusiasm for batting under Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes’ ‘Bazball’ regime. Embracing the new memo wholeheartedly, Root added a previously unseen dimension to his batting and unleashed his large repertoire of shots fearlessly. In the 2nd Test at Lord’s against New Zealand in the home summer of 2022, Root equalled his former captain Alastair Cook’s record of the youngest batter to reach 10,000 Test runs, doing so at the age of 31 years and 157 days and became only the second Englishman to achieve the feat. <br/>  <br/> Despite first opting to enter the IPL Auction in 2018, it wouldn’t be until 2023 that Root would get his first gig after getting picked up for the Rajasthan Royals for his base price of INR 1 crore. <br/>  <br/> At the World Cups <br/>  <br/> The youngest player in the 15-member squad of England in the 2015 World Cup, Root was one of the two English batters to score more than 200 runs in the competition. In his first-ever World Cup, Root recorded a century at a 110+ strike-rate, but he ended up on the losing side against Sri Lanka. You could call Root an exception in a team that is flooded with aggressive-and-powerful batsmen. While Root may not be grabbing the headlines, he’s the glue around which the other batters play. This was exactly what he was required to do in the 2019 edition of the tournament. A 'new England' under Eoin Morgan had emerged and Root was to be a vital cog of it. Playing at home, England were firm favorites to lift their maiden World Cup trophy. That they eventually did win in a less than cavalier fashion will not take away the fact that they were clearly at the top of their game. So was Root, who ended the tournament as the fifth highest run-scorer, with 556 runs from 11 innings. Joe Root would be expected to do the same at the 2023 World Cup as well. Having had enough experience of playing in India, Root in the middle-order is just the right dose for this powerful English batting order. His off-spin will come in handy as well. ",

      "bio": "A hard-hitting batsman and a wicket-keeper, Jos Buttler quickly built up a reputation for demolishing bowling attacks. His introduction to competitive cricket came at an early age and he represented Somerset's youth teams at the Under-13, Under-15 and Under-17 levels. He was a prolific run-scorer in school and junior cricket, and his consistent batting helped him come through the ranks quickly. He soon represented Somerset's second XI and was seen as a good prospect for the shorter formats. <br/>  <br/> His First-Class debut came in the 2009 season when he replaced the injured Justin Langer. Though he failed to seal his spot in the First-Class side, his performances in the other formats earned him a call-up to the Somerset limited overs squad. With regular wicket-keeper-batsman Craig Kieswetter selected to play for England, Buttler got an extended run in the Somerset team and he made the most of it, where he scored 440 runs at an average of 55 in the CB40 series. His terrific form and ability saw him retain his spot in the eleven even after the return of Kieswetter to the Somerset line-up. <br/>  <br/> Buttler then, was named as Young Wisden School Cricketer of the Year in 2010. In 2011, Buttler was selected in the T20 squad to face India and West Indies at home. He did not get to bat in his first two games and managed only 13 runs when he got his chance in the second match against West Indies. <br/>  <br/> After a successful tour against Sri Lanka for the England Lions in early 2012, Buttler made his ODI debut against Pakistan in the UAE. He then replaced Kieswetter as England's limited-overs wicket-keeper and hit his first international fifty against New Zealand in a T20I. He also played a crucial role in England's Champions Trophy campaign in 2013. He continued performing well in the ODI series against Australia, both at home and Down Under. In 2013, he made the move to Lancashire and scored his first hundred for the county in June 2014. <br/>  <br/> Buttler played a key role in England's tour to West Indies, scoring an aggressive 99 in the third ODI, which helped England post a mammoth total and secure a series win. He continued his rich vein of form in the T20s, however, England lost the series. He was also part of England's World T20 campaign in Bangladesh. The wicket-keeper batsman grew in stature ever since he was given a consistent run by the selectors. In the ODI series against Sri Lanka at home, Buttler scored his maiden ODI ton off just 61 balls, it is the fastest hundred by an England batsman. When Matt Prior stepped down from the Test side after the loss to India at Lord's, Buttler was drafted in and handed a debut in Southampton. He scored 85 in his very first Test. <br/>  <br/> Like England, Buttler had a rather modest time during the 2015 World Cup, his only score of significance coming against Bangladesh - in a match that England shockingly lost and were dumped out of the tournament even before the quarter-final stage. Buttler since became a vital cog in England's One Day plans, consistently scoring runs at a good pace. His runs came at a brisk pace and England suddenly became the team to beat in the shorter formats of the game. Quick with his hands and an ability to find gaps in the field, Buttler's multidimensional batting won him a massive contract with the Mumbai Indians - before the 2016 Indian Premier League auctions. While his run was smooth in the shorter formats of the game, Buttler seemed to have regressed in Tests. He didn't feature in whites for England until the very end of 2016 when his ability to play spin won him a place in the England squad for the Tests in Bangladesh and India. Buttler’s first taste of English captaincy came in the limited overs leg of the Bangladesh tour after several senior members, including regular skipper Eoin Morgan, refused to tour citing security concerns. <br/>  <br/> Buttler got his chance in whites during the India leg and promptly responded with a fine 76. Post his Test debut, though, Buttler didn’t quite manage to seal a place for himself in red-ball cricket, although he continued to be a part of the squad, playing as a specialist batsman. <br/>  <br/> After a few sensational years, 2017 was a rather middling one for Buttler. Runs didn't quite flow for him although there were a lot of times when the situation demanded instant hitting. That didn't quite come off consistently for him in the year. In 2018, Buttler’s performance was instrumental in England’s whitewash over Australia in an ODI series. In the 3-match series, Buttler scored two fifties and a dramatic hundred in the third game, coming in at 27-4 to rescue England to a respectable position and take them through to a winning total. <br/>  <br/> It was Buttler’s wicket that triggered the collapse against Bangladesh in the 2015 World Cup which eventually led to England’s embarrassing exit from the competition. His valiant half-century against the Asian side went in vain as England lost their last four wickets for just 22 runs. Before his 65 against Bangladesh, Buttler also played a cameo - 19-ball 39 - against Sri Lanka, but was another knock that came in a losing knock. The wicket-keeper batsman was under-used and England failed to enter the knockout stages. <br/>  <br/> When Jos Buttler smashed England’s second fastest ODI century (Buttler holds the record for England’s fastest too) just a few weeks before the 2019 World Cup against Pakistan, former England captain Nasser Hussain put Buttler in the same category as that of Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, MS Dhoni and Viv Richards. It was by no means an exaggeration. A phenomenal talent, Buttler can single-handedly win matches for his team and he can put even the best bowling attacks under pressure - courtesy his 360 degrees hitting. <br/>  <br/> Part of England’s historic World Cup winning squad in 2019, Buttler made crucial contributions throughout the competition. Buttler wasn't the enforcer, he was more of a finisher. His numbers weren't great, 312 runs at an average of 34. 67, but his strike-rate, close to 123 per 100 balls, was evident. Buttler's knocks at the end of the innings had bearings towards the end result - a superb World Cup title triumph. <br/>  <br/> In the first series post the pandemic in 2020, Buttler scored a standout 152 in the final Test against the West Indies but was criticized for his glovework after dropping several chances. In the 2021 World T20, Buttler scored an unbeaten 101 against Sri Lanka to become the first English batter to score a hundred in all formats. Later the next year, in a game against the Netherlands where England scored a historic 498, Buttler contributed an unbeaten 162 off just 70 deliveries. That series turned out to be Eoin Morgan’s last in ODI cricket and Buttler was handed the white-ball reins. Later in 2022, Buttler captained England to victory in the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia. His contributions with the bat were vital and he was praised for his astute captaincy. <br/>  <br/> Despite being one of the most explosive batsmen in world cricket, Jos Buttler had to wait for an IPL debut, primarily due to the curfew that was imposed on English cricketers for participation. Once that was lifted from the 2016 season onwards, Buttler obviously fetched a good price as he got picked by the Mumbai Indians. He juggled between the opener slot and a middle order position, getting a few starts without really making it big. The 2017 season was also more of the same for Buttler as he was used as a floater by the MI franchise. It was evident that the tournament hadn’t seen the best of him, like international cricket had been seeing for a while now. <br/>  <br/> The move to Rajasthan Royals in the 2018 auctions sparked a fresh lease of life for Buttler who however, started as a middle order batsman for the franchise, like his MI days. With the surfaces of Jaipur not as conducive as the ones in Mumbai, the struggles against the older ball was profound for Buttler. It was an enigma, considering that it’s the position he bats for while representing England. A late move in the season to promote Buttler as an opener produced immediate results, as he smashed five consecutive fifties to propel the Royals into the playoffs. Since then, he primarily batted as an opener in T20 cricket and excelled in the BBL too for the Sydney Thunder. <br/>  <br/> The 2019 season saw Buttler scoring three half-centuries for the Royals in eight innings before heading back home - to prepare for the World Cup. Buttler, unfortunately, didn’t get the necessary support from the other batsmen and hence his performances went in vain and Rajasthan had a mediocre season. After being pushed back into the middle-order in 2020 to aid team balance, Buttler had mediocre returns and things didn’t change too much in 2021 either as he started off batting at 4. The following season, however, Buttler produced mind-boggling figures. Pushed back up the order, Buttler scored four centuries that season, equalling Virat Kohli’s record, on-route to 863-runs - the second highest tally in an IPL season. He won the Orange Cap and also the Most Valuable Player award in a season where the Royals faltered at the final hurdle to the Gujarat Titans. <br/>  <br/> Jos Buttler will be leading England in World Cup 2023 and given his experience of playing in IPL, the skipper will be looking forward to making an impact for the defending champions. He has the ability to mix caution and aggression and England will be expecting Buttler to fire and be at his best in order to defend their World Cup title. The flamboyant batter loves to bat in Indian conditions and opposition bowlers need to be wary of his exploits in the tournament.",

      "bio": "Born in Burnley, Lancashire, James Anderson is perhaps the best swing bowler in the world at the present moment. He made his England debut in the season of 2002 and for the best part of five years till late 2007 remained in and out of the side. He produced a sensational spell in the 2003 World Cup against Pakistan that heralded his arrival, but he couldn't maintain the momentum and drifted out of the side.  <br/>  <br/> During the early part of his career he was considered too soft and lacking the attributes of becoming a top-class performer at the international level. But since late 2007 he has been on another planet. With wickets coming against every side and after having mastered the Aussies in Australia his resume now looks complete.  <br/>  <br/> During those inconsistent years, when he was out of the side, the England coaching management tinkered with his bowling action which resulted in a loss of confidence and form. But once he went back to an action that was based on his old one, he was back to his best - swinging the ball around corners and taking wickets by the plenty. His stand-out performance came in the 2010 Ashes when he spearheaded the England attack and bowled quite outstandingly with the Kookaburra ball taking 24 wickets - thereby exorcising some of the ghosts of his previous visit to Australia in 2006 when he took only five wickets.  <br/>  <br/> With a classical side-on action, he generates natural outswing and with the old ball is capable of reverse swinging it. When he is on song and when the conditions suit his style, he is pretty much unplayable and has often produced balls that pitch on middle and leg and hit off-stump, leaving the batsmen bewildered.  <br/>  <br/> With the bat, he is quite a handy lower-order batsman and his biggest achievement so far has been going through 54 test innings without a duck - which is a World Record. For a fast bowler, he is a mighty good fielder and is quite an athlete. He moves quite swiftly in the field and possesses a safe pair of hands which has seen him field often at gully and backward point.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Some interesting facts about Anderson: Continued alteration of hair styles, attractive looks, and up-to-the-minute outfits earned him comparisons with some of the most recognisable sport personalities around, including David Beckham.  <br/>  <br/> He is married to Daniella Lloyd an English model he met in 2004 and they are blessed with two daughters.  <br/>  <br/> Anderson became the first cricketer to model naked for Attitude, 'Britain's biggest-selling gay magazine', in September 2010.  <br/>  <br/> In June 2013 in the ICC Champions Trophy match against Australia, Anderson became England's leading ODI wicket-taker when he took his 235th wicket and went past Darren Gough. He also became England's second highest wicket-taker in Tests when he took his 326th wicket in the fifth Test against Australia at The Oval in August 2013.  <br/>  <br/> England pinned a lot of hopes of their spearhead Anderson for the 2013-14 Ashes series Down Under but unfortunately, the right-armer could not do much and his side eventually went on to lose the series 5-0. However, Anderson made up for the Ashes debacle with a superb 2014 home summer against Sri Lanka and India. The ace England fast bowler tried his best to save the Test series against Sri Lanka when he batted for 55 balls and was out off the penultimate ball of the game. He was adjudged England's Man of the Series. He then continued his fine form against India, though he was criticised for not capitalising on a green-top wicket at Lord's - a match which England lost, he came back well in the next three games and helped his side win the series 3-1, he was the leading wicket-taker with 25 wickets and he also won another Man of the Series award. In the series against India, Anderson was involved in a record last wicket partnership with Joe Root, the pair added 198 runs and bettered the previous record in Tests by 35 runs. He also registered the highest score for an England No. 11 when he went onto make 81.  <br/>  <br/> Anderson was ruled of the Sri Lanka tour with a knee injury. However, he made a comeback in the tri-series in Australia involving India as well. He will also lead the England attack in the 2015 World Cup campaign. On 8th September 2017, Anderson became the first England (6th overall) bowler to take 500 Test wickets. West Indies' Kraigg Brathwaite became his 500th victim during the second innings of the Lord's Test. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> He is on Twitter @JimmyAnderson9 and is often seen having a friendly banter with Graeme Swann.  <br/>  <br/>  by <b>Srivathsa and Akshay Maanay</b> <br/> ",

      "bio": "The son of current ICC match referee Chris Broad, Stuart Broad is a tall medium pacer who has impressed his way into the England team. His meteoric rise over the years led to the selectors appointing him as the England T20 captain at one point of time, but his reign didn't last long.  <br/>  <br/> Like his father, Stuart Broad ventured into playing cricket primarily as an opening batsman. However, he resorted to bowling because he did not want to stand around all day in the field. Following impressive showings at the U-19 level, Broad was selected to play in a T20 match against Pakistan in 2006. Broad put in a credible performance by just missing out on a hat-trick in the match.  <br/>  <br/> His turning point came in the 2007 ODI series against India when he shared a record 8th wicket stand of 99 with Bopara to guide England to a two-wicket win. Earlier, he had snapped up 4/51 in the India innings and that won him his first Man of the Match award. <br/>  <br/> However, Broad had some torrid times ahead. He took a real pounding in the match against India in the 2007 T20 World Cup when Yuvraj Singh created history by carting him for six sixes in one over. Broad has never managed to shake that moment off, but his confidence and belief helped him overcome that blip.  <br/>  <br/> He toiled hard on his Test debut in Sri Lanka as he showed admirable heart in adverse circumstances. He starred with both bat and ball during the New Zealand and South Africa series, but he was at his best during England's victorious 2009 Ashes campaign. He had fired a warning shot against the Aussies at Headingley when he took 6/91 and blasted 61 off 49 balls. It was in the fifth Test at the Oval that Broad churned out his best ever performance. His spell of 5/37 ruined Australia's chances and helped England to victory.  <br/>  <br/> He also scored a century at Lords in the year 2010, something that his father had never achieved. It was his first ever century in any form of cricket and came when England needed it the most. His team was struggling at 102 for 7 against a brilliant Pakistan bowling attack and his 332-run world record stand with Trott helped England recover and seal the series. <br/>  <br/> Broad had a poor Ashes tour of 2011 as it was cut short due to injuries and was out of the squad for most of the Test and ODI series. He was almost dropped from the side before the India tour but after being named in the team for the first Test, he went on to pick up 7 wickets in the match. He also scored a classy 74 not out in the second innings. The same brilliant form continued in the second Test when he hit an aggressive 64 with the bat and achieved superb bowling figures of 6-46 in the first innings, which included a hat-trick. His second innings contribution (44 runs and 2 wickets) was just as useful. He went on to take 6 wickets in the next two Tests as England completed a 4-0 series whitewash. <br/>  <br/> Broad started the 2012 summer with a bang when he took 7/72 against West Indies in the first innings of the Test at Lords, becoming the 8th all-rounder to feature on both honours boards  after his maiden Test century of 169 against Pakistan in 2010. He took another 4 wickets in the second innings to finish with Test best figures of 11/165 and became the first bowler to take a 10 wicket haul at Lords since Ian Botham in 1978.  <br/>  <br/> Later that year, Broad failed miserably against South Africa in the first Test as England bowlers suffered at the hands of South African top order batsmen. In the second Test, however, Broad did manage to make up for earlier mistakes finishing with figures of 5/69 as England ended the game in a draw. His dip in form continued into the Test series in India and he was dropped after the first Test. An injury kept him out of the ODIs and T20s but he returned to the side for the tour of New Zealand in 2013. <br/>  <br/> He had a very good Ashes in 2013 in England, he ended the series with 22 wickets. He was the Man of the Match in the fourth Test at Chester-le-Street, where he had match figures of 11/121. He bowled a fiery spell and brought England back in the match as he helped them retain the Ashes.  The biggest talking point of the series though was Stuart Broad's bull-headed refusal to walk despite genuinely nicking an Ashton Agar delivery to the waiting hands of Michael Clarke at first slip via Brad Haddin's pad in the Trent Bridge Test. This ugly controversy, which saw sparks fly all round, set the tone for the return Ashes Down Under. Infuriated by Broad's behaviour, the Australian press launched a scathing attack on him with the public hopping onto the bandwagon as well. Never the one to back down from a challenge, the lean mean pace machine fought fire with fire, picking up 6 Aussies wickets in the first innings at the Gabba. However, it could not prevent his side from crashing to a cataclysmic loss. The miserable form for his home side continued as England ended up being whitewashed for the third time in Ashes history. He was England's best bowler on display and finished as England's leading wicket-taker.  <br/>  <br/> After Alastair Cook opted to take a break at the conclusion of the series Down Under, Broad was named as the captain for the tour to West Indies as well as the 2014 World T20. England won the ODI series 2-1 but were beaten in the three-match T20 series that followed. Under his captaincy, England couldn't do much in the World T20 and failed to go past the Super-10s stages. <br/>  <br/> When India toured England in 2014, he played a crucial part in piloting the hosts to a 3-1 series win. The tall fast bowler picked up 19 wickets in the series, which also included a Man of the Match performance at Manchester for his 6/25. Broad, however, had to undergo a knee surgery which he had prolonged for a while, he timed the surgery in a way that would see him fit before the World Cup. And as he had planned, he was named in the squad that was picked for the tri-series, where Australia played hosts to England and India.  <br/>  <br/> The Nottinghamshire pacer didn't have the best of World Cups. However, he was instrumental in helping England to reclaim the Ashes in 2015. In the absence of the spearhead of the pace attack, James Anderson, Broad decimated Australia with a supreme spell of 8 for 15 in the fourth Test at Trent Bridge, as the tourists hurtled towards a defeat.  <br/>  <br/> Broad also proved his worth when England toured the UAE and South Africa. In fact, it was his game-changing spell of 6 for 17 in the third Test at Wanderers that paved the way for the visitors to pip South Africa in their own den. Eventually, England won the series 2-1. After his awe-inspiring spell at Wanderers, Broad also topped the ICC Test Bowler Rankings. <br/>  <br/> But even as his Test aura continues to rise, the focus on 'new England' in the shorter formats of the game has meant that Broad has struggled for a place in the ODI and T20I setup. He even missed the marquee World T20 where England made the final.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Cricbuzz staff</b> <br/> ",

      "bio": "The tales of 'Beefy' Botham's booze-fueled bowling coup in Mumbai and Gibbs' hangover masterclass at the Wanderers are the stuff of legend; instances of such extraordinary talent, that even the laws of nature surrender to them.  <br/>  <br/> Kevin Pietersen, of South African descent, was a similar precocious talent, bringing such inconceivable skill and swagger back into the gentleman's game for the first time since King Viv. Walking into the haughty world of English cricket, Kevin Pietersen was the quintessential rebel; an outcast destined to play for a team that just didn't hold with such brash nonsense.  <br/>  <br/> Pietersen served his qualification period to play for England by 2005. In an orchestrated attempt at theatricality or by mere coincidence, as soon as Pietersen stepped into South Africa for his first major ODI series, controversy followed him. He had a volatile relationship with the South African crowds, who had turned hostile and viewed him as a 'traitor'. However, in his own signature devil-may-care fashion that would be his trademark over the remainder of his career, Pietersen remarked 'I just sat back and laughed at the crowd, with their swearing and traitor comments.' Furthermore, he reinforced his stature with the bat as well, and by the time he scored the last of his 454 runs in the 5 ODIs, the crowd treated him with growing respect rather than hatred.   <br/>  <br/> In the 2005 Ashes, a man walked into the historic Oval in London, and gave us a glimpse of the signature uprising; a flash of peroxide highlights, tattoos, and flying cricket balls later, Australia found themselves staring at a target in excess of 300. A cocky, spoilt-looking bully had walked in with the lead at 73 and led an audacious counter-attack, scoring 158 and striking 7 sixes against an attack comprising of Brett Lee, Glenn McGrath, and Shane Warne. Australia had had a taste of their own medicine. Australia had to remain content with a draw and conceded the 2005 Ashes, thanks to a freak of an innings against the world's best bowling.   <br/>  <br/> KP had arrived.  <br/>  <br/> Having cemented his spot in the side, Pietersen continued to impress with decent numbers at home and away. He startled the crowd with his signature switch-hit, changing his stance at the last moment and audaciously slog-sweeping Muttiah Muralitharan for sixes in the home series against Sri Lanka in 2006. Pietersen earned the distinction of scoring centuries in 3 consecutive innings in that tour. Pietersen continued to pile on the runs at an alarming rate including a tally of 444 in the 2007 World Cup in just 9 games, earning him the nickname of the 'shining' in the team, 'like a 100 watt bulb in a room full of candles'. Alas, however, a clash in ideologies between the captain, the coach and the larger-than-the-game Pietersen started to get ugly.  <br/>  <br/> After the resignation of Michael Vaughan, the natural successor to the job was Kevin Pietersen. His reign started auspiciously with a 4-0 whitewash of the South Africans in a home ODI series. This, however, proved to be a false dawn, as Pietersen's men were bull-dozed 5-0 in the ODI series in India, a seven-match series cut short by the notorious 26/11 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. In a commendable stand against terrorism, Pietersen decided to return to India to play the Test series, a closely fought affair which India ended up winning 1-0, thanks to a stupendous run-chase on a deteriorating Chennai track. Poor on-field showings caused drama off the field as Pietersen and coach Moores had a public falling out. Pietersen was granted his wish as Moores was sacked by the ECB, but so was Pietersen as on-field performances continued to disappoint. However, relationships remained strained as the newly-appointed coach Andy Flower and captain Strauss weren't in the best terms with Pietersen either.  <br/>  <br/> In 2010, things seemed to be falling into place for England, as Pietersen and Cook piled on the runs for England, in their exemplary showing in the Ashes in Australia. Having missed the 2009 Ashes due to injury, Pietersen decided to compensate for it by scoring 360 runs at an average of 60, including his Test best of 227, and winning their first Ashes series in Australia after the turn of the millennium. After a few injury concerns, including a pivotal hernia causing his withdrawal from the 2011 World Cup in India, Pietersen returned to form in the home series against India, scoring 202* at Lord's in the historic 2000th Test and making the occasion his own. He went on to score 533 runs in England's 4-0 drubbing of Dhoni's men, at a Bradman-esque average 106.60, and once again played a pivotal role in a big moment for English cricket as they earned the Test championship mace from India to become the number 1 ranked Test side in the word.  <br/>  <br/> Adding another feather to his already-decorated cap, Pietersen delivered a man of the tournament winning performance in England's 2010 World T20 victory in the Caribbean islands; a rare addition of an ICC trophy in their cabinet. Pietersen scored 248 runs at an average of 62, with a crucial 47 in the final.  <br/>  <br/> The text message controversy followed Pietersen on the tour to South Africa, as he had allegedly sent South African players messages criticising his coach and captain. He went on to score a typically audacious 149, against a decorated South African attack, including 60 off 12 overs against Dale Steyn. He was dropped from the 3rd Test (obviously due to off-field reasons) against the Proteas after failing to defend himself about the text messages and England subsequently went on to concede their number 1 ranking in the process. Pietersen, however, followed a re-integration process recommended by the ECB, and completed the process to be in contention for the tour of India.  <br/>  <br/> English cricket would be thanking their stars, for had it not been for KP, they would not have had an away win to celebrate. England went on to edge India 2-1 in the 4-match Test series, delivering their first series win in the country since 1985, scoring a pivotal 186 on a rank-turner in Mumbai – one of his finest innings in alien conditions till date.  <br/>  <br/> Pietersen's batting started deteriorating in early 2013, with very few innings of note and rash dismissals. England's 2013 Ashes thrashing Down Under, as they buckled under the furious pace of Mitchell Johnson, was followed by habitual top-scorer Kevin Pietersen getting the sack after having played his 100th Test in the series owing to the need to reform 'team ethics and philosophy' and a controversial England career was brought to an abrupt and unceremonious end.  <br/>  <br/> Pietersen remains a valuable asset in franchise-based T20 cricket around the world and currently plays for the Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash League. He contributed handsomely in the 6th edition of the league scoring 268 runs in 8 matches at an average of 38.29 but a surprisingly low strike-rate of 128. However, Pietersen remains a player who provides the psychological edge to the Stars and the remains the crucial X-factor player who has spent his entire life playing against the odds and - in his own words - 'sitting back and laughing at them'. That innate KP-ness of the man set him apart from the rest.  <br/>  <br/> Regardless of the off-field controversies, Kevin Pietersen performed in all the big moments for his team in the last decade, and is undoubtedly, a great of the game.  <br/>  <br/> Love him or hate him, you just can't ignore him. He was Kevin Pietersen - the man we loved to hate. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Rishi Roy</b> <br/> <i>As of December 2017</i> <br/>  <br/> ",

      "bio": "'15,000 Test runs and 50 Test centuries are not beyond him' - Sunil Gavaskar said about Alastair Cook.  <br/>  <br/> It is not easy for a batsman to receive such high praise from a former cricketer, especially when the concerned persons are from different countries. The fact that those words came from a batsman who is considered one of the best openers Test cricket has ever seen makes it even praiseworthy. Such is Cook’s reputation in World Cricket at the moment that, at the age of 28, he is already considered as a legend, or at least one in the making.  <br/>  <br/> It is never easy being a Test opener in the country of England – the new ball generally swings rapidly and it takes a great deal of quality for any opener to survive, let alone score runs consistently. But Cook is blessed with a robust technique, temperament and the patience required to counter the conditions even when they are not conducive to batting, especially at the top order.  <br/>  <br/> Nothing describes Cook’s ability to score runs more than his high scores in Test cricket. He has more Test centuries than any other English batsman to have played the game. More than the number of centuries, what’s impressive is his hunger for big runs even after scoring a hundred. England’s batting coach – Graham Gooch – insisted on his batsmen to score “Daddy hundreds”, and not be content with just centuries. Cook learnt those lessons to perfection and has 7 scores in excess of 150, including 2 double centuries. While his highest score of 294 against India at Birmingham in 2011 was a marathon knock which showcased all his qualities – patience, class, technique and ability to bat long, his 122 against the same opponent on a rank turner at Mumbai in 2012 elevated him to the league of legends.  <br/>  <br/> The toughest Test for any batsman, especially from England, comes when he goes to Australia or India. The former because of England’s historical rivalry (the Ashes), and the latter because of England’s struggles in the spinner-friendly Indian pitches. Cook has not only passed both the tests, but has also returned staggering numbers in both continents.  <br/>  <br/> It was evident right from his Test debut that Cook was someone who would make it big. He started his Test career with a century against India in 2006, and went on to score centuries in his first appearances against Pakistan, West Indies and Bangladesh and also became the second youngest player to get to 5000 runs in Tests, after the legendary Sachin Tendulkar. He suffered a loss of form in 2008, but recovered the very next season and rose rapidly up the ranks in world cricket. His consistency with the bat made him the obvious choice for captaincy after Andrew Strauss, and his cricket attained new heights after the responsibility was thrust on him. Cook has made 6 centuries from his first 7 Tests as captain, a stat made even more astounding given that 6 of those Tests were played in the sub-continent.  <br/>  <br/> Cook has an extraordinary ability to learn and adapt to conditions and situations in quick time. His favourite shots are the cut and pull, and that enables him to play short pitch bowling with extreme ease. That explains his success in Australia – he has scored 1042 runs from 10 matches down under, with 4 centuries and an average in excess of 65. While his strong back-foot play has helped him score runs on the bouncy tracks in Australia, his ability to come on the front-foot and use his height for a long stride has led to tremendous success in the spinner friendly Asian conditions – he has 1802 runs from 18 matches in the sub-continent, with an average of 56.31 – a mindboggling stat for an Englishman in conditions that suit spin. His brilliance at the top of the order helped England win the Ashes in Australia in 2011. He scored 3 centuries in the first 3 Tests in India and was the biggest factor in England winning the Test series in India in 2012. He was the highest run getter and Man of the Series in both the occasions – a trivia which speaks for itself.  <br/>  <br/> There is one quality about Alastair Cook that goes unnoticed among his many characteristics – his ability to adapt to various formats. Being the correct batsman that he is, he was a victim of branding and was considered fit only for the longer versions of the game. But he proved all of them wrong after he was given the ODI captaincy post the 2011 World Cup. Cook has scored 4 of his 5 ODI centuries as captain, and his average as captain (47) is considerably more than his average as a normal player (40).  <br/>  <br/> Undoubtedly, Cook enjoyed a thoroughly fruitful 2013 as England captain, having marshalled his troops to an emphatic 3-0 Ashes triumph at home before England finished runners-up in the 2013 Champions Trophy.  <br/>  <br/> Cook and his men though received a brutal reality check in the subsequent Ashes opener at Brisbane with their arch-rivals surging to a mammoth 381 run win. Cook went on to become the youngest ever to play 100 Tests, beating Sachin Tendulkar in the 3rd Ashes Test in Perth. However, the down-slide continued and England suffered a humiliating 5-0 whitewash Down Under. Their pitiful plight extended in the ODIs as well as they were able to win only one game. Under the scanner for his passive captaincy and harsh demands of stepping down from the job, Cook decided to skip the West Indies tour in early 2014.  <br/>  <br/> Having already won an Ashes series away from home, albeit as a player, Cook followed the 2013 Ashes win at home with another in 2015. He didn't get a hundred as a batsman, but his overall contributions was invaluable. It was then followed by a massive 263 against Pakistan as England nearly threatened to derail Pakistan in their new fortress, Abu Dhabi. It turned out to be minor consolation that His team went on to lose the next two Tests and the series.  <br/>  <br/> Cook put that debacle behind him as he led his team to a stunning 2-1 win over South Africa in the 2015-16 winter. That meant he had added South Africa to his overseas collection which had also included India. 2016 turned out to be a tough year for Cook - he didn't do too badly with the bat, as his 1270 runs with two Test hundreds, but his captaincy came under severe test. The success against South Africa was followed by a comfortable home series win over Sri Lanka but then things went pear shaped.  <br/>  <br/> England only managed a 2-2 series draw against Pakistan at home but the worse was yet to come. They lost a Test in Bangladesh for the first time ever and it was followed by a convincing 4-0 demolition at the hands of India. Cook - the batsman, struggled in India and was particularly susceptible to the left-arm spin of Ravindra Jadeja - who got him dismissed five times during the course of the series. There were calls for him to quit England captaincy at the end of the series and Cook's body language suggested that he has had enough of leading England.  <br/>  <br/> As expected, Cook resigned from the captain's role on 6th February 2017 after leading the side for an English record 59 Tests. His record includes Ashes victories at home in 2013 and 2015 as well as series wins in India and South Africa. However, Cook has stated his willingness to continue playing on as a batsman in the longest format of the game. <br/>  <br/> After handing over the reins Joe Root, there seemed to be an air of nonchalance in Cook's approach to batting. Although he, admittedly, struggled during 2017-18 the South Africa series at home, the next series offered him the opportunity to stamp his mark as one of country's best Test batsman. Cook went onto score 243 at Edgbaston in the series opener against the Windies, where England crushed the visitors by an innings and 209 runs.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Interesting fact</b>: Alastair Cook's 243 was the highest individual score where a batsman was adjudicated OUT with the help of DRS. <br/>  <br/> <b>Cricbuzz staff</b>",

      "bio": "Eoin Joseph Gerard Morgan has represented both Ireland and England at the international level and has earned respect as an inventive and free-stroking middle-order batsman, especially in the shorter formats. If we trace back Morgan's early career, he was a key player in the Irish youth teams at the Under-17 and Under-19 level. At the age of 17, he was selected for the Under-19 World Cup to represent Ireland and he was the top-scorer for his team. Two years later, he was chosen as the captain of the Under-19 side, where he finished as the second highest run-getter of the tournament.  <br/>  <br/> Morgan made 99 on his ODI debut for Ireland against Scotland in August 2006 - the only player in the history of the game to have been dismissed for 99 on debut. 'Moggie', as he is nicknamed, then made his maiden ODI century against Canada on 4th February 2007 and became the youngest non-subcontinental player to score a century in ODIs. A 21-year-old Morgan was part of a spirited Ireland team in the 2007 World Cup, which progressed to the Super Eights. The southpaw, batting at three, didn’t have a great tournament as he managed to score only 91 runs in 9 innings.  <br/>  <br/> The southpaw earned his recognition in England when he represented the England Lions in a tour match against South Africa. He was a part of an unbeaten 113-run partnership with Samit Patel and helped the Lions secure a six-wicket victory. After his notable performances for the English Lions, Morgan was named in the 30-man squad for the ICC World T20. He then had to quit playing for Ireland as he was also chosen in the 15-man squad for the World T20 for England. <br/>  <br/> Morgan's big break came during the Champions Trophy in South Africa in 2009, where Matt Prior was unavailable, thus paving the way for Morgan to keep wickets and bat for England. He scored back-to-back 60s against Sri Lanka and South Africa, particularly relishing the South African attack while making 67 off 34 balls.  <br/>  <br/> He made his Test debut against Bangladesh in May 2010 and scored 44 in the first innings. In the ODI series against Australia, later that year, Morgan scored an unbeaten 103 off just 85 balls in the first game, followed by a 50 in the second to win Player of the Series award. He further cemented his place in the English side with a breathtaking 45-ball 85 in a Twenty20 match against South Africa.  <br/>  <br/> Morgan was one of the better buys at the third IPL auction, with the Royal Challengers Bangalore snapping him up for his base price for USD 220,000, but his performance in that edition was modest. IPL 2011 proved to be a tad better for Morgan as he represent Kolkata, scoring 137 runs in nine innings.  <br/>  <br/> A successful domestic season saw him being selected for the Sri Lanka Test series. He scored 168 runs in four innings that included two half-centuries. Morgan also compiled 158 runs in the ODI series. Later that year, he was named as the England vice-captain for T20 side.  <br/>  <br/> During the 50-over World Cup held in the subcontinent in 2011, Morgan was called in as a replacement for Kevin Pietersen in the midst of the tournament. He became only the fourth player to have represented two different nations in Cricket World Cup. Morgan recorded two half-tons in three innings, but both those knocks came in losing cause.  <br/>  <br/> In the Test series against India in 2011, Morgan scored only 19 runs in the first three innings. However, he came back with a flourish as he scored a rapid half-century against a modest Indian bowling attack. In the third Test, he scored a brilliant hundred as England amassed more than 700 runs.  <br/>  <br/> After the India series, Cook was rested for a one off-ODI against Ireland and Morgan led the team to become only the third Irish player to lead England (The other two were Timothy O'Brien and Frederick Fane). What followed was the forgettable tour to UAE, where Morgan was able to score a mere 82 runs, averaging 13.66 in three Tests. He was later dropped for the two match Test series when the team toured Sri Lanka in March 2012. His journey after that was quite insignificant and thumb injury didn’t help his cause.  <br/>  <br/> However, he got back to form later in the year and delivered solid performances against Australia in the ODIs at home as well as Down Under. He was then named the vice-captain of the squad for the West Indies tour and the World T20 in 2014. Morgan was soon named the captain of England's ODI side, after Alastair Cook was axed, two months before the World Cup. In only his first ODI as permanent captain, Morgan scored a marvellous 121 against Australia. <br/>  <br/> The 2015 World Cup humiliation is what inspired Morgan to lead an ODI renaissance, that saw England re-brand itself as New England. The captain's new-age methods found support from Andrew Strauss, who was made the Director of Cricket by the ECB, and together the pair worked diligently to rework the archaic methods that plagued England's ODI mindset for long. Flatter limited-overs pitches were encouraged, players were given more confidence to play freely and an IPL window was opened for the players to try and seek exposure of the big platform. And the transformation has been such that England changed drastically from a conservative limited-overs side to one of the most feared batting units in the world in white-ball cricket.  <br/>  <br/> The 2017 Champions Trophy had England starting as strong favorites due to their phenomenal transition as well as the fact that the tournament was being held at home. However, they were thwarted in the semifinals by a mercurial Pakistan side who were having a redemption of their own and eventually won the coveted trophy. Despite the blip, England continue to be a formidable limited-overs unit due to their fearless approach and enviable depth in the side. Morgan had a fairly good tournament personally as well as captain. His contribution as a skipper both in terms of tactics as well as backing his mates has been pivotal to England's progress. A dangerous middle order batsman on his day and a more than shrewd captain, Eoin is a vital cog of England's white-ball cricket fortunes.  <br/>  <br/> Taking over the ODI captaincy duties from Alastair Cook on a short notice, Morgan struggled to keep his unit together during the 2015 WC. His form dipped to new lows as a batsman as the left-hander scored just 90 runs in five innings as England exited the competition after the league stage. It’s been a stunning turnaround from England after the 2015 debacle -  with Morgan’s captaincy playing a big role too. Personally, the southpaw has amassed 3039 runs in 75 innings at a strike-rate close to 98.5 since the previous World Cup - England’s second highest run-getter in that period. England had lost just one (a one-off ODI against Scotland) of their last 10 series, but it would count for nothing if the hosts, who went to the 2019 World Cup, as the overwhelming favourites, failed to make the most of the favourable conditions. England started well in their title pursuit, but suffered mid-tournament blues. Morgan's men lifted themselves though in the nick of time and there was no stopping them later on, a breeze against Ashes rivals Australia in the semis and a rule-contrived victory over New Zealand in the final at Lord's. Morgan had justified the call made by the selectors four years back and England had clinched their maiden World Cup crown.  <br/>  <br/> Franchise T20 leagues across the globe have often expressed their interest in purchasing Morgan's services and he has been a busy man in that regard as well. His power hitting and ability to stay calm under pressure makes him an asset in the fast-moving T20 format.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Abhinand Raghavendran</b>",

      "bio": "A right-handed wicket-keeping batsman who plays for Yorkshire, Jonny Bairstow is the son of former England keeper David Bairstow. His introduction to the game was natural and came at an early age, and within no time rich accolades came his way. He was chosen as the winner of the Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the year award for his 654 runs in the 2007 season. Soon, he went on to represent Yorkshire's second XI and impressed many with his consistent batting, scoring 308 runs at an average of 61.6 in 2008. This included a 139 not out against Worcestershire at Headingley Carnegie. In October that year, Bairstow signed a full time contract with the county side. <br/>  <br/> On his first class debut in 2009, he top-scored with an unbeaten 82 in the second innings. He went on to become a regular in the county team over the next two years, and averaged more than forty in both. He scored eight fifties, but could not convert them into triple-figure scores. 2011 turned out to be a better year for the youngster, as he was selected in the England Lions squad for the tour to West Indies in January. In May that year, he scored his maiden first-class century (which he converted into a double) and was picked for the national squad to play against Ireland in an ODI game in August. However, he was not selected in the playing eleven. <br/>  <br/> His first international appearance came in the fifth ODI game against the visiting Indians in Cardiff, and he made it special with a stunning 21-ball 41 to help England win the match. Further success during a warm-up match against India and in T20s against Pakistan led to Bairstow's first Test call to face West Indies. At the beginning of the 2012 season, Baristow had hit two brilliant hundreds for Yorkshire and was eager to capitalize on that achievement. His Test debut against West Indies, however, was not that eventful and was mediocre with the bat. <br/>  <br/> He was then ignored for the first two Tests against South Africa in 2012 in favour of Ravi Bopara but was recalled for the third Test when Kevin Pietersen was dropped. Bairstow responded effectively by hitting a gritty 95 and left the field to a standing ovation. He again hit a classy half century in the second innings but it was not enough to help England to victory. He later went on to hit his second highest first-class score of 182 against Leicestershire at Scarborough in the LV Championship and also managed a terrific 68* in the semi finals of Friends Life T20 against Sussex. <br/>  <br/> Although Bairstow was selected in the England squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20, his contribution was negligible and failed to flourish with the bat. Bairstow was included in the England team that toured India in 2012-2013 and performed exceptionally well in the warm-up match against Mumbai A, hitting a remarkable 118. He was only included in the squad for the second Test to replace Ian Bell but did not make a significant contribution to warrant an inclusion for the third Test. <br/>  <br/> A strong 64 laced with powerful cuts and controlled pulls at his home ground in Headingley against the Kiwis in 2013 handed Bairstow his much awaited Ashes debut at Nottingham. However, Bairstow managed only a lone fifty in the 4 games he played to cap a rather shoddy series. Bairstow then traveled to Australia for the return Ashes series and played a couple of games at Melbourne and Sydney respectively, but could not do anything special to bail his side out of trouble. It was the tour of South Africa in 2015 that saw Bairstow turning to his best. <br/>  <br/> The wicket-keeper batsman made his maiden Test hundred in Cape Town, was involved in a stunning 399-run stand with Ben Stokes for the sixth wicket and ended the series with 359 runs at an astonishing average of 89.75. He then began the home summer with two hundreds against Sri Lanka. A solid series against Pakistan was followed by solid showing in his first tour of the sub-continent. 2016 was a year to remember for Bairstow - not just for his 1470 runs at an average of 58.8 but also for his 70 dismissals as a wicket-keeper, a record for the most dismissals by a keeper in a calendar year. <br/>  <br/> Every English and Australian player is defined by how they fare in the Ashes. Although England suffered a hammering in Australia during the 2017-18 series, Bairstow was among the very few visiting batsmen to impress. Unlike many of his mates, he seemed comparatively at ease against Australia's rampaging pace attack and also had a century to his name in Perth. Given the number of starts he got, Bairstow would be disappointed at having under-achieved through the series. However, it was a tour that was only going to improve him mentally. <br/>  <br/> Bairstow found it hard to break into the XI as the wicket-keeper batsman in the shorter formats - courtesy Buttler's heroics. However, his imperious form during the 2016-17 coupled with Jason Roy's lean patch forced the selectors to pick Bairstow as the opener. It didn't take long for him to make a mark as he notched up two centuries in the home ODIs against West Indies in 2017. <br/>  <br/> In 2018, Bairstow became the first English batter to record three successive ODI tons. The later part of that year saw Bairstow lose his form. When he twisted his ankle while playing football in training during the away series against Sri Lanka, it almost seemed that he had gifted his spot in the playing XI away as three players (Bairstow, Alex Hales and Jason Roy) were competing for two spots. However, Alex Hales’s withdrawal from the World Cup squad in a way solved the team management’s problem as the opening spot was fixed. <br/>  <br/> Bairstow has been an integral member of the ‘New England’ team which not only entered the multi-nation competition as the ranked one side in the world but also as one of the favourites to win the tournament. He had a superb World Cup, scoring two hundreds and two fifties while playing all games for England. Jonny Bairstow was the second highest run getter for England in that historic WC winning campaign for England.  <br/>  <br/> Post the 2019 World Cup, Bairstow’s white ball game took a dip, and it culminated in a disastrous 2021 T20I World Cup where he scored just 47 runs across six games. This led to Bairstow’s eventual axing from the white ball setup, with the selectors opting to go for more and more format specialist players. However, this proved to be a blessing for him and English cricket, as Bairstow came into his own as a Test batter. He was the only English player to score a century in a really forgettable Ashes Down Under, where England lost 4-0.  <br/>  <br/> Bairstow followed that up with a century away to West Indies as well, where once again he was a shining light for his side in a forgettable tour. England’s dismal form as a team led to some changes in the coaching setup, as Trevos Bayliss was axed with Brendon McCullum replacing him. This proved to be another blessing for Jonny Bairstow, as McCullum came in and asked this England team to play free and without inhibitions. Jonny Bairstow was the first crown prince of this English Bazball revolution, as he completely obliterated a visiting New Zealand team. He scored a century in two out of the three Tests, fittingly claiming a Man of the Series accolade. Bairstow also scored a century in the rescheduled fifth Test against India, helping England draw the series 2-2.  <br/>  <br/> Jonny Bairstow was looking like the glue around whom the English red ball team was being constructed, but a freak leg injury while golfing kept him sidelined for a substantial period. He returned to the fold for England's 2023 summer starting with a Test against Ireland where he didn't get a bat before going on to play the Ashes. While he had a decent series, scoring 322 runs at an average of 40.25, Bairstow was primarily in the news for being controversially stumped by Alex Carey in the second innings of the second Test at Lord's after leaving his crease before the ball was declared dead.   <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/> Jonny Bairstow registered for the IPL for the first time only in 2019, and was picked by Sunrisers Hyderabad. He formed a lethal combination there alongside David Warner, opening the batting. The duo both scored centuries in a game against RCB that season - first and only time in the IPL that two openers have scored tons. Bairstow averaged in excess of 55 and held a strike rate of over 150 in his first season.  <br/>  <br/> The next season however there were depreciating returns from Bairstow as the IPL shifted to the UAE, as Bairstow’s strike rate dropped below 125 and his average dipped to 31.96. The next season, he started brilliantly for SRH- scoring 248 runs in seven matches before the IPL was called off, and then didn’t turn up for the UAE leg of the competition citing bubble fatigue. Bairstow was picked by Punjab Kings in the 2022 mega auction, and had a sketchy tournament as he was being batted all round the order. Bairstow was retained for the 2023 season but was ruled out due to injury. ",

      "bio": "An English cricketer of Pakistani descent, Moeen Ali, played county cricket for Warwickshire before moving over to Worcestershire after the 2006 season. He enjoyed a successful stint at Warwickshire, winning the NBC Dennis Compton Award for two years in a row in 2004 and 2005. <br/>  <br/> He was a child prodigy and at the tender age of 15 rivalled many established cricketers. He was awarded the captaincy of England's Under-19 squad for the 2006 World Cup and took the team to the semi-finals, a particularly impressive performance coming from a 11-0 drubbing received in Bangladesh, earlier that year. Moeen, continued to be a consistent performer for Worcestershire and was the acting captain at the start of the 2011 season as the usual club captain, Daryl Mitchell was injured. <br/>  <br/> Moeen had the most prolific championship season in 2013, scoring a whopping 1,375 runs in 17 First-Class games, which included four tons and eight fifties. His bowling was equally outstanding as he gathered 31 wickets. This strong display earned him the Professional Cricketers Association's player of the year award, a place in the England Performance Programme tour to Australia and was also picked in England Lions’ trip to Sri Lanka. He then, made his ODI debut against West Indies in February 2014 and registered his maiden fifty in the third ODI. He also played the 2014 World T20 in Bangladesh. <br/>  <br/> It was Moeen's off-breaks that earned him a call to the England Test side. After the retirement of Graeme Swann, England were searching for a spinner to take up the vacant role and they saw Moeen fit for the job. He made his debut against Sri Lanka at Lord's and made 48 in his very first innings. During the second Test, Moeen showed his pedigree with the bat by scoring a patient 108 not out and almost saved the game for England, but failed to do so as the last man James Anderson fell to the penultimate ball of the game. <br/>  <br/> During the home series against India, Moeen bamboozled the opposition batsmen with his off-breaks. The visitors didn't respect the off-spinner and kept giving him wickets. By the end of the series, Moeen had picked up 19 wickets and was the second highest wicket-taker for England. However, he could not contribute much with the bat as he failed to score a single fifty. <br/> Coming back to the ODIs, after Hales failed to impress, Moeen was given the opportunity to open the innings in Sri Lanka. The Worcestershire man didn't disappoint, as Moeen scored his maiden ODI ton at Colombo (RPS). Since that knock, he has made the opening slot his own. Having been picked for the 2015 World Cup, Moeen will be someone to watch out for, with both bat and ball. <br/>  <br/> Moeen belongs to a strong cricketing pedigree, with his brother Kadeer and cousin Kabir, both playing in the county circuit. Once termed as an elephant in the dressing room, Moeen Ali grew leaps and bounds post the 2015 World Cup and established a crucial spinner-cum-all-rounder slot in the Test side. During the Test series in India, Moeen struggled to match the quality of Ashwin and Jadeja, but made useful contributions with the bat. His breakthrough point in Test career came against South Africa at home, where he bagged 25 wickets whilst piling up 261 runs in 4 Tests for which he was accorded with the Player of the Series award. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> The post 2015 World Cup England side has seen him explosive players and Moeen Ali is one among them. With ECB allowing their players to participate in the IPL, it was no surprise that Ali was one of the nine English players to be picked. Royal Challengers bought him for INR 1.7 crore. <br/>  <br/> He did not start immediately as the team preferred seam bowling all rounders like Woakes and de Grandhomme. But Ali did get a chance and in his fourth game, played a match winning knock of 64 and was involved in a 107-run stand with AB de Villiers where he outscored the South African. That small glimpse was enough to convince the RCB management to retain him for the next season. In the 2019 edition, Moeen struck two fifties and a couple of cameos for his franchise. However, in certain games Moeen was under-used by his team. With the ball, his economy rate was under 7. The Englishman left his team before the conclusion of the tournament to prepare for the World Cup. <br/>  <br/> Ahead of the 2021 auction, Moeen was bought by Chennai Super Kings for INR 7 crores and was retained for INR 8 crore ahead of the 2022 mega auction. <br/>  <br/> World Cup 2023 will probably be Moeen Ali's last ODI World Cup, and the dashing all-rounder will certainly be looking forward to making it a memorable one by contributing in both the departments. He has the ability to mix caution with aggression, strike big sixes and his bowling in Indian conditions will also be an advantage for the defending World Cup champions.",

      "bio": "Born on March 2, 1989, Chris Woakes made his First-Class debut against a touring West Indies 'A' side for Warwickshire in Birmingham in August 2006. Two years later, he made headlines by topping the bowling charts for his side in the season, picking up 42 wickets at an average of 20.57. His fine performances got him an entry into the England Lions side and also a place in the preliminary 2009 World T20 squad. <br/>  <br/> In the same year, Woakes was near unplayable against the West Indies, bagging 6/43 in the first innings, bowling for the England Lions in a warm-up match. He is not just all about taking wickets with the ball, Woakes, is a very handy batsman too. He has a few First-Class centuries to his credit, with the most notable being an unbeaten 131 against Hampshire. During the course of that innings, he also shared a mammoth 222-run partnership for the ninth wicket with Jonathan Trott. His first international appearance came in the shortest format of the game, a T20I between England and Australia in January 2011. Woakes made his ODI debut against Australia in Sydney in 2011. Exactly a week later, on January 30, he registered his career-best figures of 6/45 against Australia in Brisbane. <br/>  <br/> An injury to Tim Bresnan in August 2013 meant that Woakes made his Test debut at The Oval against the visiting Australians in the Ashes. He played a few county games after that and went to Australia later on to play matches in the Big Bash League for Sydney Thunder. Soon after, he travelled to Sri Lanka along with the England Lions to play some First-Class games against Sri Lanka 'A'. Woakes got a surprise call-up for England's T20 side to play the 2014 World T20 as a replacement for Ben Stokes, who injured himself banging a door in the dressing room after being dismissed cheaply in a T20I in West Indies. <br/>  <br/> Since his return to the national side, Woakes has been impressive. He was even recalled to the Test side for the home series against India. In the ODIs that followed, Woakes was England's go-to bowler. He was the leader of the attack in Sri Lanka as James Anderson and Stuart Broad missed the tour due to injuries, he did his reputation no harm as he picked up 14 wickets in the seven-match series. <br/>  <br/> There would be some major disappointment in store in the marquee 2015 World Cup where England would crash out in the group stages itself, despite the all-rounder having a fairly reasonable tournament on a personal level. Then came the Ashes where Woakes had to spend the summer on the sidelines owing to England's already star-studded bowling attack which had no vacancy. He had been doing a decent job, but there hadn't been any real standout performance which would make him undroppable. In the following ODI series, he was in and out of the side as the Three Lions would go down to a 2-3 scoreline. <br/>  <br/> Stokes's emergence as a match-winning all-rounder meant that Woakes never sealed a spot in any format, being that they are similar players. And there is this unsaid belief, a baffling belief, of picking a team with variety. He wasn't even in the English squad for the World T20 in what would have been a major setback. But as fate would have it, an injury to Stokes opened up a place in the XI against the touring Lankans in 2016. An opportunity presented, an opportunity grabbed. Woakes made his presence felt and didn't look out of place in the company of Broad, Anderson and Finn. Then came the breakout Test. One which will remain etched in memory for a long time for various reasons. With 11 wickets in the match and a gutsy batting performance in both innings at Lord's against Pakistan, and following it up right through the fascinating series with tremendous consistency, Woakes has surely grabbed the brass ring. <br/>  <br/> There are moments which define a player's career, and change it for good. That tour by Pakistan might just be it. Even though England did end up on the wrong side of the result. Woakes had a good IPL 2017, where he participated after England opened its doors for its players to participate in the cash-rich league. He formed an important member of Kolkata Knight Rider's pace battery, helping the franchise adapt from a slow-low to a pacy-bouncy track at the Eden Gardens. <br/>  <br/> Despite having impressive performances in his career, there is a glaring flaw that Woakes' stats show - his performances away from home. This was on show during his tours of South Africa and India although there was a belief that he would repair the damage sooner than later. He had a good time at home in 2017 against South Africa and West Indies but the away challenge of the Ashes saw him failing miserably. Much like a lot of his peer fast bowlers, Woakes seems to rely a lot on conditions that aid movement. <br/>  <br/> When on song, he can click high 130s and perhaps even touch 140 but his average speed remains somewhere near the mid 130s. <br/> Woakes' had these issues in Tests but has been largely unaffected in white-ball cricket where he has been terrific for England across the globe. His ability to strike with the new ball and also bowl well at the death makes him a handy customer. It is also well known that he can be a more than effective batsman, considering his basic technique and power hitting skills. With Anderson reaching the last stages of his career, the onus will be on Woakes, who is seen as a natural successor, to prove his ability in the longer format of the game.",

      "bio": "Is it fair to say Adil Rashid would have had a much better career at the international level if he wasn't representing England? Fair to say - Yes. The team's long researched aversion to any kind of spin has meant that a promising career has never quite taken off - at any format of the game. Come to think of this - Rashid made his One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 (T20I) debut way back in 2009, but then had to wait six long years before he could bowl in whites. <br/>  <br/> Rashid's Test selection came on the back of two back-to-back county championship wins for Yorkshire - his long loved club. Rashid had a very slow and painful start to his Test sojourn - getting smashed for almost 5 runs per over on his debut against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi. One of the major complaints about Rashid was his inability to string together quiet overs - he had the ability to take wickets - and he showed that aspect as well in the same Test - grabbing his maiden five-wicket haul. <br/>  <br/> While the series against Pakistan was an educative experience, Rashid was expected to deliver the goods when he was chosen as the main spinner during England's arduous 7-Test tour of the sub-continent - with two Tests lined up against Bangladesh and a further five against India in 2016. Albeit against tough opposition, this was Rashid's chance to shine. <br/>  <br/> Rashid featured in all the seven Tests and finished with a haul of 30 wickets - not bad for a leg-spinner against the mighty sub-continental batsmen. But his consistency was sorely missing, there were as many as five four-wicket hauls, but none of them were converted into five-wicket hauls. The wickets came at a cost as well - not even once in his 12 bowling innings did he concede less than 3 RPO. England only managed one win out of seven, losing five and drawing one and Rashid was sent down the pecking order. <br/>  <br/> Rashid didn't play a Test since the India tour for some time and his chances of gaining another 'Three Lions' cap looked bleak. While his Test future didn't look good, Rashid became a vital part in the scheme of things in the new-look England ODI squad. He became a valuable asset for the Morgan led side as England brought about a bit of a renaissance in ODI cricket after the 2015 World Cup. <br/>  <br/> Rashid's bowling average or even his economy of 5.5 isn't staggering for a leg spinner in today's modern era. However, it's his knack of picking up wickets that has made him stand apart. While he appeared tensed in Test cricket due to the attacking fields that was given, thereby increasing the pressure on him to be accurate, it seems like Rashid loves the in-out fields that are in use for the shorter formats. <br/>  <br/> Rashid, who had decided not to play red-ball cricket with his county, in a surprised/controversial move was recalled for the Test squad against the home Test series against India in 2018 following his performances against the same opponents in the 50-over format. Later that year, he was a key member of the England squad that whitewashed the Island nation in a 3-match Test series in Sri Lanka. <br/>  <br/> Rashid was a crucial cog in England's famous World Cup victorious campaign and although he didn't take a truckload of wickets, he did ensure that England had a dominating presence, especially during the crucial middle-overs phase of the game. This after he enjoyed a rich vein of form in 2018 with 42 wickets to his name from 24 ODIs.  <br/>  <br/> Having missed the bus for the 2010 T20 World Cup triumph, Rashid made amends by ensuring he remained a pivotal part when England won the T20 World Cup in 2022 under Jos Buttler. Rashid might not have featured in a lot of the ODIs post the pandemic but expect another string showing from the leggie in the 2023 World Cup as the conditions would certainly favour him. <br/> <b>By Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "A hard-hitting opening batsman, Jason Roy earned his maiden call-up to the English side for the one-off T20I against India in September 2014 on the back of cracking 677 runs at a superb average of 48.35 in that season's Natwest T20 blast. Roy has also been a good performer for the English Lions.  <br/>  <br/> Roy has not done badly in first-class cricket but limited overs cricket, which grants him the freedom to express himself, is his stronger suit. The South African-born batsman brought with him that X-factor, which the English ODI side desperately needed for the 2015 World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> The Surrey batsman, along with Alex Hales, has been pivotal in putting the English top-order woes to rest in white-ball cricket after a disastrous 2015 World Cup campaign. With minimal feet movement, Roy can hit the ball a long way especially with the flashing cross-bat swing that he, often makes it look so easy. He slammed two hundreds against Sri Lanka in England in 2016 compiling his highest ODI score while at it. There was no looking back since then. He is preferred as the first choice opener and despite failures, he is touted as a key member of the new-look England side.  <br/>  <br/> Roy ran out of chances during the 2017 Champions Trophy, in a crucial semifinal encounter against Pakistan, he was dropped and Jonny Bairstow took his place. However, with runs in the NatWest T20 Blast, Roy returned to the T20 side line-up and slammed a 67 in the second game against South Africa. After the comeback into the ODI team he has grown from strength to strength. His breathtaking innings of 180 against Australia at the MCG overhauled Alex Hales 171 as the best ODI score by an England batsman. And his 221 run stand with Joe Root in the same match was the team’s highest ever for the third wicket in one-day cricket.  <br/>  <br/> Jason Roy represented Gujarat Lions and Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League in 2017 and 2018 respectively, but decided to pull out of the tournament in the following season owing to World Cup preparations.  <br/>  <br/> <b>World Cup - What to expect</b> <br/>  <br/> “If Bairstow don't get you, Roy must,” could well be the theme of the World Cup as England enter the mega tournament as firm favourites. With Roy and Bairstow at the top of the order followed by plethora of world-class batsmen, the England line-up is certain to give nightmares to its opponents.  <br/>  <br/> Roy came back strongly after he was omitted from the playing XI in the midst of the 2017 Champions Trophy. His incredible knock at the MCG in January 2018 made him almost undroppable from the squad and the right-hander hasn’t looked back ever since. In England’s final ODI series before the World Cup, Jason Roy shone with the bat in all three innings against Pakistan posting scores of 87, 76 and 114. Like his batting partner Bairstow, Roy too will carry no baggage of the previous World Cup horrors.   <br/>  <br/> <b>World Cup 2019</b> <br/>  <br/> England finally got hold of the silverware that had been eluding them for almost 40 odd years. They won the 2019 WC in a stalemate of game against new Zealand and at the fore front of the campaign was Jason Roy.  Jason started off with a quickfire fifty against South Africa before smashing 153 against Bangladesh. But then tragedy struck England and Roy. He tore his left hamstring and missed out on three games. England ended up loosing two of those games and were staring at an elimination in a do-or-die game against India. <br/>  <br/> But Roy announced his comeback in his typical inimitable style spanking Indian bowlers to all corners of the park enroute a 57-ball 66. His opening partnership with Jonny Bairstow produced three consecutive 100 plus partnerships and that paved the way for an England triumph. <br/>  <br/> Roy's white ball prowess isn't a secret anymore but his red ball technique has been often questioned. But England selector threw weight behind him and Roy made his Test debut against Ireland ahead of Ashes 2019, a series for which he has been picked. <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Abhinand Raghavendran</b> and <b>Kumar Abhisekh Das</b>",

      "bio": "Wood hails from the same place as his idol Stephen Harmison - Ashington from Northumberland. He is not the same as Harmison or any of the typical English bowlers. Wood is 6ft tall and is pretty much a hit-the-deck bowler. He gets movement, but usually he beats the batsman for his pace. The right-arm quick can generate good pace and bowl consistently at 140kph or above.  <br/>  <br/> Wood started his career with Northumberland and played for them between 2008 to 2010. He then joined Durham in 2011 and in his first season itself, he took 19 wickets at 21.63 including a 5-fer that won his side the game against Nottinghamshire. Paul Collingwood's decision to promote young talent helped Wood as he was pivotal when Durham won the county championship in 2013. The fast bowler ended the season with 27 scalps at 24.07.  <br/>  <br/> Wood's consistent performances earned him a place in the England Test side during the 2015 series against New Zealand. In his first four games, Wood claimed 14 wickets and his work rate was horsemen like, but still he was overlooked for the third Ashes Test, Steven Finn replaced him. However, due to his raw pace and accuracy, Wood continued to be in the selectors' radar.  <br/>  <br/> Despite injuries plaguing him at regular intervals, Wood has been a key component of England's limited-overs attack. His ability to unsettle the batsmen with pace makes him the X-Factor of the attack. He also played a couple of Tests during the 2017 summer at home against South Africa but was barely impressive. Wood got hit by injuries again and that forced him to miss the Ashes campaign in Australia. During the embarrassing drubbing suffered, England dearly missed a bowler who could clock high speeds like Wood. Ironically, he was there in Australia at that point, playing for the England Lions in the shorter formats.  <br/>  <br/> However, the think tank weren't convinced of his ability to get through a five-day game just yet and that meant that he wasn't picked. If he can stay fit regularly, there is no denying the fact that Wood could become one of England's most potent pacers in the years to come. His numbers in international cricket thus far are anything but impressive. However, it is only a matter of time before he gets those right. An injury-free Wood adds so much value to the England unit. In 2018, he selected by the Chennai outfit in the Indian Premier League, but he returned home after playing just one game in a bid to keep his place in the Test side.  <br/>  <br/> After being largely overlooked in the latter portion of 2018 in the ODIs, Wood made a big statement in the longest format against West Indies. When England had already lost the series and were trailing 0-2, Wood produced a Man-of-the-Match award winning performance by claiming 5/41 in 50 balls - his maiden Test fifer - at St. Lucia. This performance helped him regain his mojo back and the pacer followed it up with a good show in the 50-over format against the same opponents. <br/>  <br/> Wood had only one ODI to prove his worth before the 2019 Cricket World Cup when England locked horns against Pakistan. In one of the best batting-tracks at Nottingham, the right-handed pacer’s bowling figures of 2/71 was good enough for him to seal a spot in the 2019 World Cup squad. While Wood had a middling World Cup, he was famously run-out off the last ball of the final as England only managed to level New Zealand's score before going on to also tie the super-over and then win on a boundary count. Wood ended up suffering a side-strain and missed the following Ashes series.  <br/>  <br/> Returning to the side for the third Test on England's tour to South Africa in 2019-20, Wood played a crucial part with ball but also scored crucial runs down the order with England going on to win the series 3-1.  <br/>  <br/> Wood was part of England's squad for the 2021 T20 World Cup and the subsequent 2022 T20 World Cup which England won. He ended up injuring himself again during the Super-12 stages and missed the knockouts.  <br/>  <br/> Wood was a part of England's squad again for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Abhinand Raghavendran</b>",

      "bio": "Dawid Malan is a late bloomer in the international circuit. The Roehampton-born left-handed batsman has been a consistent performer for Middlesex for more than a decade and the national honours was a just reward for sheer consistency. <br/>  <br/> A pivotal part of the Lord's based Middlesex county, Malan's sheer volume of runs spoke for himself, although a middling first-class average in the late 30s kept him distantly low in the queue for a national call-up. He had announced his arrival with a stylish 51-ball 103, which was termed by his then Middlesex captain, Ed Joyce, as one of the finest ever T20 innings played from a 20-year old. <br/>  <br/> However, Malan could never achieve the heights in first-class cricket and it wasn't until 2014 that he finished a season with an average greater than 40. 2016 turned out to be a turning point in his career though as he plundered an unbeaten 126-ball 185 against Sri Lanka A in Northampton - a record score for the Lions. <br/>  <br/> Malan received a call-up to the national T20 team for the three-match series against South Africa in 2017 and promptly responded with a swashbuckling 44-ball 78 on debut, for which he was named Man of the Match. England's floundering batting order meant a spot in the middle-order opened up and Malan was called mid-way through the South Africa Tests. Up against a quality visiting attack, Malan made just 35 runs from four innings. He however followed it up with a much better series against West Indies, scoring 154 runs, including two half-centuries. <br/>  <br/> With a dwindling Test average, Malan was selected for the Ashes series in 2017-18. In a tour, where the England team was drubbed 4-0 by Australia, Malan’s performance with the bat was a bright spot for the visitors. He registered his maiden Test ton at the WACA in Perth and crossed fifty on three other instances.The left-handed batsman played to his limitations and adapted to the different situations. He racked up 383 runs in nine innings averaging above 40 and ended up as the leading run-getter, and by far the best batter for his side in the series. In T20s, he became an international mercernary and played in various leagues. This in turn helped his game at the international level and Malan became the first player to go past the 900-point mark in T20I Rankings in 2020.  <br/>  <br/> However with the 'Bazball' era setting in, Malan wasn't quite in the scheme of things and didn't play a Test after January 2022. But his stocks in white ball cricket kept on increasing. The pandemic didn't help but ahead of the World Cup in India, Malan managed to score 5 centuries from 15 innings to edge out Jason Roy. He can be measured and destructive in equal measures at the top of the order and England would be looking up to him to deliver at the 2023 World Cup. <br/>  <br/> <b>Little known facts:</b> <br/> - Born in London, Malan grew up in South Africa.  <br/> - His father and brother have played first-class cricket. <br/> - He made his first class debut at the age of 18 for Boland, before being picked by Middlesex.  <br/> - Sporting heroes: Graeme Smith, Jacques Kallis and Mark Boucher.",

      "bio": "Liam Livingstone is a right-handed aggressive batsman from England, who is more than handy with his arm and a livewire on the field. Liam made his first-class debut for Lancashire in April 2016 and played a fantastic knock of 70 against Nottinghamshire. As a result of Livingstone's contribution in that match, Lancashire managed to topple the 300-run mark against Nottinghamshire and managed to win that first-class encounter by 8 wickets at Manchester. <br/>  <br/> Livingstone is someone who has the ability to hit big sixes and he has played franchise cricket over the past few years. His international debut came against South Africa in 2017 at home. Batting in the middle order, Liam's contributions in that T20I series were 16 & 0 respectively after which the youngster failed to make it to the England squad. It took until 2021 for Livingstone to stage a comeback to the national setup, as he got a break thanks to an injury to Joe Denly. He made his debut in 2021 in an ODI series against India, averaging 63 across that series. <br/>  <br/> It was a few months later that year in a series against Pakistan that unleashed Liam Livingstone to the world. He scored the then fastest T20I fifty and hundred for England in that series, getting to that feat off 17 and 42 balls respectively. Livingstone also smashed a 122m six off Haris Rauf in that series - replays of which were doing the rounds on social media for months on end. <br/>  <br/> Livingstone got a space for himself in the ODI team as well soon enough, with a role opening up for him with the retirement of Eoin Morgan. He scored a 17-ball fifty in an ODI against Netherlands, which was the fastest by an English batter as the team beat their own record to smash a whopping 498 runs in their innings. Livingstone was also part of the English side that won the T20I World Cup in 2022, although he didn’t have much of a role to play given the team combinations. Post the WC, he was also handed a solitary Test cap when England toured Pakistan, though his performance wasn’t all that inspiring. <br/>  <br/> Holding the record for the fastest 50 in ODIs and the fastest hundred in T20I for England, it isn’t rocket science to deduce that aggressive batting is Liam Livingstone’s USP. He is known to attack from ball one and is a very difficult player to control once he gets going. However, Livingstone has been a bit of a hit or miss commodity with some big frailties on turning tracks and against spin. Apart from his batting, Livingstone can also chip in with handy leg-breaks/ off breaks and is a gun fielder too. In short, he is a perfect package for white-ball cricket, especially in this no holds barred English setup. <br/>  <br/> Liam Livingstone given his prior experience of playing in India might well be a handy guy. The boundaries won't be that big and his big hits are well documented. But his part time spin will also come in handy for Jos Buttler and his men. ",

      "bio": "Cricket literally runs in his blood. The third generation around - his grandfather being a First Class cricketer for Rhodesia, his father being a national cricketer for Zimbabwe - Sam Curran is one of the many white African cricketers of this decade to have moved out of his traditional roots and to have relocated in the United Kingdom to ply his trade.  <br/>  <br/> A diminutive, mild-looking left-arm seamer whose natural angle helps him swing the Dukes away from right-handers, he doubles up as an able batsman lower down the order; and given the ease at which he looks with bat in hand, it could soon become his primary skill. <br/>  <br/> While his brother, Tom Curran, rose up to become primarily a limited-overs bowler, Sam went the more conventional route. Hailed as a prodigy in his younger days, he progressed rapidly into Zimbabwe's under-13 ranks before relocation, and then through Surrey's age-division cricket and became the second youngest player to make his FC debut for Surrey at 17 years and 40 days, impressing immediately with a five-wicket haul on debut against Kent.  <br/>  <br/> He was soon picked for the 2016 under-19 World Cup, followed by a spot in the England Lions' tour to the UAE later in the year. An injury to Ben Stokes meant that Sam was fast-tracked into national reckoning, getting his maiden Test cap at Headingly against Pakistan in June 2018.  <br/>  <br/> His biggest moment under the sun came in the home summer of 2018 against the then number one side in the world, India. Picked primarily as a bowler, it was his abilities with the bat from number eight that helped rescue England after middle-order collapses, match after match. It was no surprise when he was named the Man of the Series for his all-round contributions (272 runs and 11 wickets) that saw England win 4-1. He carried on his form into the Sri Lankan tour, playing a key role in England whitewashing the islanders.  <br/>  <br/> However, his red ball game dwindled in the coming months, with mediocre returns on his tours to New Zealand and South Africa. Injuries also took a toll on the youngster, and a back injury kept Curran out for a substantial part of 2021, where he missed the T20 World Cup and that season’s IPL.  <br/>  <br/> Sam Curran’s white ball form though was moving in a different trajectory, as he shot to fame with a Man of the Match performance while on tour in India, where he scored 95* in an ODI and almost chased down a huge target of 329 from an improbable situation. Shortly after that series, Curran picked up his first fifer in ODIs against Sri Lanka. And then Sam Curran’s crowning moment in limited overs cricket came in the 2022 T20I World Cup. He was given a new role as a death overs bowler in that tournament, and performed spectacularly. Curran started the World Cup with a fifer against Afghanistan, and ended it with a Man of the Match 3/12 performance against Pakistan in the final which helped England claim the trophy. He picked up 13 wickets in the tournament, at an average of 11.38 to be named the Player of the Tournament.  <br/>  <br/> Curran’s form has taken a slight dip since that World Cup, with meager returns while touring South Africa and Bangladesh. Nevertheless, he remains a mainstay of the English white ball setup, having improved his bowling significantly and being a handy customer lower down with the bat as well.  <br/>  <br/> Curran soon lost his place in the English setup with a change in management, and wasn’t part of the squad for the 2025 Champions Trophy.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL Through the Years</b> <br/> Sam Curran’s Man of the Series performance against India in the 2018 Test series came at the right time, as recency bias made teams stretch their purses to acquire his services for the 2019 season. Despite being a relatively unknown commodity in T20 cricket, Curran commanded top dollar as he was picked by Punjab Kings. He had a very ordinary first season in the IPL, where the lack of swing on flat Indian pitches made him enjoy to bash for the batters. Curran’s economy suffered massively that season, but he did manage a decent return on wickets which included a hat-trick against Delhi Capitals that turned the game for his side. Curran was also used as a top-order pinch hitter on occasions, and scored one fifty.  <br/>  <br/> The following season, Curran was released by Punjab Kings and picked up by Chennai Super Kings. He was the shining star in a Chennai side that massively underperformed in the 2020 IPL in the UAE, and contributed decently with ball and bat. Curran continued his fine form in the 2021 season, when CSK came roaring back but had to pull out of the UAE leg of the competition with a back issue. The left-arm bowler then sat out the 2022 IPL, and when he registered himself for the next auction off the back of a very successful T20 World Cup, Sam Curran became the most expensive player ever in IPL history, as he was reunited with Punjab Kings.  <br/>  <br/> Sam Curran was used as a bits and pieces player by Punjab in the IPL - often promoted up the order to score quickly and used as an all phase bowler later in the innings. He captained PBKS for a good chunk of the 2024 season with regular skipper Shikhar Dhawan suffering an injury. Curran was crucial in the away wins against Kolkata and Chennai. Despite some solid performances, his hefty price tag meant that Punjab couldn’t retain him and went back to the auction pool. Curran suffered a brutal price correction in the 2025 IPL auction as he was picked for just 2.4 crores by Chennai Super Kings.  <br/> ",

      "bio": "One of the most exciting fast bowlers of the modern era, Jofra Archer in full flow is a sight to watch - smooth rhythmical run-up, braced front-knee on delivery, and the ability to bowl very fast and trouble the best batters in the world. The potential was never in doubt, even before he set foot on the international stage. So much so that England were willing to fast-track him into their squad for the 2019 World Cup ahead of other candidates who had been with the group for a while. The rest, as they say, is history. <br/>  <br/> Born and raised in Barbados, Archer made the move to England after not getting enough opportunities back home. Having shown a lot of promise in school cricket, he got the chance to represent the West Indies U19 team but was left out of the U19 World Cup. He also couldn't make it to the Barbados squad in domestic cricket. So thanks to his British passport (courtesy of his British father), and some help from Chris Jordan - another Barbados native playing for England - Archer found a place at Sussex in England's domestic circuit, where he didn't take long to make an impression. In his first full season in 2017, Archer picked up 61 wickets in the County Championship at an average of 25.29. Later that year, he represented Hobart Hurricanes in the BBL and wowed global audiences with his ability, including the IPL franchises. He was picked up by Rajasthan Royals for INR 7.2 crore in the IPL 2018 auctions and performed well in his debut season with 15 wickets in 10 matches. <br/>  <br/> A few months before the 2019 World Cup, ECB changed its qualification criteria from seven years to three years of residency, opening the door for Archer to be catapulted into the World Cup squad. He made his ODI debut in May 2019 against Ireland, before leapfrogging other contenders to be included in the squad for the mega-event. He finished the tournament as England's leading wicket-taker and played a big role in helping them lift the trophy for the very first time.  <br/>  <br/> There was more success to follow in the same year as he made a memorable Test debut at Lord's during the Ashes. His battle against Steve Smith became stuff of legend as he bowled a spell of terrifying pace and eventually hit him on the helmet with a nasty bouncer, leaving him concussed. He picked up 22 wickets during the series at an average of 20.27, although it wasn't enough to stop Australia from retaining the Ashes as the series finished 2-2. <br/>  <br/> Unfortunately, things went south from there for the pacer as injuries started to take a toll on his body. He missed a significant chunk of cricket in 2020, including the IPL, because of a stress fracture in the right elbow, and then underwent two surgeries in 2021 to sort out the same while missing the Ashes and the T20 World Cup in UAE. Targetting a return in 2022, his plans were foiled by a stress fracture of the lower back and he ended up missing the T20 World Cup again. He then made a comeback in 2023 by playing the ODI series against South Africa, but suffered a recurrence of the elbow injury, cutting short his participation in the IPL and ruling him out of the Ashes as well as the ODI World Cup. <br/>  <br/> Archer returned to action in 2024 and played in the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and USA. His workload was carefully managed as he was eased back into action in the limited-overs formats, playing a role in the ODIs against Australia, and then being a part of the tour of West Indies in late 2024, and India in early 2025. In between, he was signed by Rajasthan Royals in the IPL 2025 auction for INR 12.5 crore.",

      "bio": "Pipped as a generational talent, Harry Brook took Test cricket by storm when he ended as the top-scorer in a 3-match Test series in Pakistan. While scoring 468 runs at an average of 93.6 from 5 innings on his first tour to the subcontinent was impressive enough, what made Brook's achievement truly remarkable was the fact that those runs came at an astounding strike-rate of 93.41. A true acolyte of the 'Bazball' philosophy, Brook, after just a handful of Tests, was a testament of what Ben Stokes' renewed Test side stood for.  <br/>  <br/> An impressive upcoming young batsman, Brook was no stranger to being in the headlines. After making his first-class debut for Yorkshire against Pakistan A in 2016 while still being a schoolboy, Brook made his County Championship debut the following year in 2017 having racked up several noteworthy performances for the 2nd XI. Brook's maiden first-class hundred came in a crunch situation in a game against Essex at Chelmsford. Yorkshire were blown out for just 50 in the first innings with Brook himself, opening the batting, making a 3-ball duck. Under pressure to save the game, Brook, this time batting at three, made a magnificent 124 and Yorkshire eventually went on to win the game. While Brook had showcased his potential, he struggled with consistency. <br/>  <br/> While that was Harry Brook in red-ball cricket, he had far better returns in limited-overs cricket and it was actually his performances here that shot him into greater recognition. Named the captain of England's Under-19 squad during the 2018 World Cup, Brook led from the front as he became only the second English player to make a century at that level, after Alastair Cook - when he made 102 against Bangladesh. He ended the tournament as England's highest run-scorer, with 239 runs. At the domestic level, Brook had an impressive T20 Blast in 2020 and returned with an even stronger performance in 2021. Moving up the order to number 4, Brook finished as Yorkshire's leading run-scorer with 486 runs at a superb average of 69.42 and a strike-rate of 149.07. Signed by the Northern Superchargers in the inaugural edition of The Hundred, Brook kept his performances up at the big stage and he drew the attention of the right men.  <br/>  <br/> Come the beginning of 2022, Brook was named in England's T20I squad for a series against the West Indies. He played just one game and scored just 10, Brook had already done enough to showcase his potential and the selectors wanted to see more. He was named in England's Test squad for the home summer with series' against New Zealand and South Africa and while his Test debut, much like his T20I debut, wasn't a success with him batting just once and scoring 12, Brook retained his spot for the subsequent tour of Pakistan.  <br/>  <br/> Before all his antics in Pakistan though, Brook had already won a T20 World Cup with England. Awarded a spot in England's squad for the 2022 T20 World Cup after impressive performances for both Yorkshire and the Superchargers, Brook had a poor run as he scored just 56 runs from 5 innings. Nonetheless, Ben Stokes and England kept their faith in a player that was still a young rookie and boy did he repay them in the year that followed. After a glorious tour of Pakistan, which England won 3-0 on the back of Brook's three hundreds and a fifty, he finished as the leading-scorer again in a 2-match Test series in New Zealand.  <br/>  <br/> In what was perhaps Brook's best innings yet, he walked in with England in deep trouble at 21/3 in the first innings of the first Test. With questions already being raised about England's Bazball approach in testing conditions, Brook batted with a flair that was stunning to watch, scary to bowl to and hard to fault - even for Bazball dissidents. Batting with a sense of freedom that many can only dream of, Brook struck a glorious 186 off just 174 deliveries and shared a monumental 302-run stand to rescue England. While England dramatically lost the game by 1 run, with Brook being run-out without facing a ball in the next innings, it didn't take the sheen off his outstanding start in Test cricket and returned scores of 89 and 54 in the next Test.  <br/>  <br/> Brook's next major assignment was the highly anticipated home Ashes series of 2023. While his 363 runs at an average of 40.41 and strike rate of 78.74 looked strangely mediocre relative to his prior returns, Brook's claim to fame came in the third Test when he became the fastest ever to a 1000 Test runs in terms of balls faced - getting there in just 1058 balls.  <br/>  <br/> Prior to all that though, Brook had already made an impression on IPL franchise owners and it led to him getting picked up by the Sunrisers Hyderabad for a whopping INR 13.25 crore for the 2023 edition of the tournament. Amongst Brook's long list of achievements that led to his lucrative IPL contract was his maiden T20 hundred that came playing for the Islamabad United in the 2022 edition of the PSL. However, Brook couldn't quite live up to the name he'd made for himself though and a century he scored against KKR was his only innings of note. Opening the batting but looking like a fish out of water batting against quality spin, Brook finished the tournament leaving a lot to be desired and was eventually let go by the Sunrisers. He was picked up by the Delhi Capitals for the 2024 season of the IPL, albeit at a much lower price tag of INR 4 crore.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Anurag Hegde</b>",

      "bio": "A tall, lanky left-arm pacer who has spent more time off the field than on it, Reece Topley grabbed the headlines at a very young age with his immaculate bowling. He has played for England in One-Day and Twenty20 cricket, but injuries have not allowed him to keep going for a long period of time. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Topley, at 6ft 7in, started his career with Essex like his father - Donald Topley. He picked up 14 wickets in his first three four-day games, including five wicket hauls against Middlesex and Kent. The youngster was then picked for the 2012 Under 19 World Cup in Australia and he returned as the highest wicket-taker - 19 wickets at an average of around 9. <br/>  <br/> The growing nature of his career earned him a place in the England Lions squad for the tour of Australia and when he picked 80 wickets across all formats for Essex in the 2013 season, Topley was included in England's Performance Programme, but the first injury struck during this time and he missed the tour to Sri Lanka. <br/>  <br/> Once fully fit and back in rhythm, Topley was selected for the England ODI and T20 squad against Australia in 2015. He made his debut in Manchester and only in his second game with Pakistan, he picked up 3 for 26. In his first full series in South Africa, Topley ended with 10 wickets in five games, but that was the last of his England games. <br/>  <br/> During this time, Essex could not afford the injury-prone bowler and he too wanted more recognition which he was not getting at the county side. Both parted ways and he signed with Hampshire, who were a consistent side in the shorter formats of the game. <br/>  <br/> However, another mishap at the start of the 2016 season ruled him out of the year - a bone in his right hand was broken by a Boyd Rankin bouncer while playing against Warwickshire. The next year it was a back stress fracture which limited his appearances for Hampshire as he bowled only 112 overs across the three formats. <br/>  <br/> At 24, questions were being asked about his fragile body and whether he would continue playing. Topley, however, battled through them and was picked for the Lions squad for the tri-series involving India A and Windies A. He picked up 8 wickets in the series on his way back to where he belonged, but another back problem curtailed his season. <br/>  <br/> In October 2018, Reece Topley left Hampshire after the club and the player agreed to part company. During the 2018-19 winter, Sussex took a punt on him. Having been allowed to train and recover at Hove, he progressed well and picked up 17 wickets in their T20 campaign. Sussex were keen to tie him to a new contract but Surrey gazumped them to get his services. Surrey became Topleys’ fourth county when he signed at the end of the season. In 2020, Topley was recalled into England’s ODI squad for a 3-match ODI series against Ireland and featured in an ODI match after more than 4 years. <br/>  <br/> In 2022, Topley showcased his skills in both white ball formats at the international level. He recorded the best ODI figures for an Englishman with 6/34 against India at Lord’s. Another injury mishap came just before the T20 World Cup that year. He stepped on a boundary sponge during a fielding drill before England’s final warm-up match. As a consequence, he rolled his left ankle and his ligaments ruptured. Eventually, he was ruled out of the marquee event. <br/>  <br/> Topley got picked up by the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2023 IPL auctions for INR 1.9 Crore. He made his debut against Mumbai Indians. However, he dislocated his left shoulder while fielding in that match and was ruled out of the rest of the season. <br/>  <br/> Topley made it to England’s ODI 2023 World Cup squad. A last-minute injury meant that he missed out a shot at last year’s T20 World Cup but this time around, he made it through the ODI World Cup warm-up games unscathed,",

      "bio": "A young and classy right-handed batsman, Zak Crawley initiated as a middle-order batsman when he began his journey at Kent in 2018. However, he soon found himself opening the batting and an impressive 2018-19 season has seen him go up the pecking order drastically. So, much so that England picked him as one of the backup openers for their tour of New Zealand in late 2019. Unlike many of the Test batsmen who played till the Ashes series, Crawley has the ability to score quickly and possesses a rich amount of timing. Crawley was Kent’s leading run-scorer during the 2018-19 County season with over 800 runs to his name, batting on some tricky surfaces against quality attacks. He loves to play the ball late and is quite strong off the back foot.  <br/>  <br/> Crawley made his debut in that 2019 New Zealand tour but announced his arrival when he scored 267 against Pakistan at Southampton. That innings was supposed to be the start of a flourishing career but the big scores were far and few which in turned made it difficult for him to cement a place in the Test XI. However, change in personnel; Stokes as captain and Brendon McCullum as head coach, gave Crawley a long rope and persisted with him. He has adapted to the <i>Bazball</i> mantra and been instrumental in giving England quick starts. <br/>  <br/> Zak Crawley’s first major assignment as a ‘Bazball’ opener came away to Pakistan, where he scored a century in the first innings and a fifty in the second as England managed to squeeze a result on a flat Rawalpindi wicket. He had a tepid rest of the tour and struggled away against New Zealand as well, but the management kept their faith in him for the 2023 home Ashes.  <br/>  <br/> Crawley started the series with a cracking cover drive against Pat Cummins off the very first ball in the first Test. He was the leading run scorer for England in that series, scoring two fifties and a century. Crawley followed that up with an impressive showing away to India as well. Using his height and reach, he lunged to the pitch of the ball against spinners. He proved to be the leading run getter for England, scoring four fifties. He had a decent home summer as well, scoring a couple of fifties against West Indies as England achieved a whitewash. Crawley injured his finger in that final Test and was ruled out for the rest of the home summer.  <br/>  <br/> Crawley returned for the tour to Pakistan towards the end of the year, and scored a valuable 78 in the first Test as England forced a result after Pakistan scored in excess of 500 in the first innings. He may not have been the most consistent, but his attacking nature of play fits into the brand of cricket England aim to play, thus making him an important part of the Test setup for the Three Lions.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "Some cricketers' rise to the top constitutes hours of perseverance and hardwork, and others' include, predominantly, an abundance of talent and natural ability. Abraham Benjamin de Villiers is that player you create in a computer game, who has both the attributes set to maximum, and then some.  <br/>  <br/> de Villiers has risen through the ranks to become one of the world's finest batsmen, most versatile batsmen, across all formats. When on song, de Villiers has the ability to take any bowling attack apart with his wide array of strokes on either side of the wicket. If his orthodoxy is compact and aesthetically pleasing, the South African avant-garde's trailblazing innovation often rendered bowlers speechless.  <br/>  <br/> His supreme ability caught the eye of the selectors as he was fast-tracked into the national squad as a raw 20-year-old in 2004. He made his Test debut in the home series against England in 2004 and exhibited his class with a sublime 52 in just his fourth innings with the bat, saving South Africa from what looked like a certain defeat. He also registered his first Test century in the series - a fluent 109 on his home ground in Centurion. In short, he'd wasted no time and had shown the world his capability immediately.  <br/>  <br/> Having played both as an opener and as a lower-order wicketkeeper/batsman in his first Test series, he soon proved his worth by amassing 460 runs in his first away tour to the Caribbean Islands in 2005. A slump in form ensued - de Villiers battled for runs against Australia both at home and away - he had to wait until the home series against West Indies in 2007-08 to again reach the three-figure mark. However, he made up for the lost time, spanking a fine 217 against India in Ahmedabad, the first South African player to hit a double ton against India.  <br/>  <br/> It was plain sailing later on for the flamboyant right-hander as he scored runs for fun. It included a superb unbeaten 278 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in November 2010, briefly placing him at the top of the ladder for the highest individual score by a South African batsman before Amla's 311* at the Oval less than a year later.  <br/>  <br/> de Villiers continued to grow in stature and improved his batting technique such that in addition to having the mainstream attacking game, he developed an impenetrable defence with a karate-style back-and-across trigger movement, and the late-block, which could be extended into the all-important check-drive to counter late movement off the pitch and in the air. This non-committal technique ended up making him one of the finest batsmen of the age. A compact defensive technique to stave off misbehaving balls on a minefield and a plethora of strokes in his armory to thrash the bowlers on truer wickets - AB de Villiers, the batting monster, had arrived. <br/>  <br/> Nevertheless, as great as things were in terms of individual performances, off-field events often seeped into his game. Following South Africa's exit from the 2011 World Cup, de Villiers was named as the captain of their ODI and T20I team in June. Owing to the workload and pressure, he gave up the T20I captaincy in early 2013 but continued to play as South Africa's main batsman and their first choice wicket-keeper. <br/>  <br/> Apart from his attacking strokeplay, de Villiers exhibited his ability to play the situation and conditions as well. With South Africa struggling to save the Adelaide Test against Australia during the tour Down Under in 2012-13, de Villiers curbed his natural instincts and dead-batted his way to a 220-ball 33 in one of the more exciting draws of all time, along with his partner-in-crime, Faf du Plessis. In the next Test at the WACA, his alter-ego showed up and he brutalized the red cherry on his way to a brisk 169 from just 184 balls as South Africa ruthlessly triumphed over Australia in their own backyard.  <br/>  <br/> The face of innovation in modern-day cricket, AB's achievements in the limited-overs game are more qualitative than quantitative. Nevertheless, every so often, an innings of such outrageous audacity comes along that the maverick of AB stands out even on a dull, number-loaded scorecard. Ramps over the wicket-keeper, cheeky paddles past short fine or the audacious reverse sweeps and reverse-pulls off <i>fast-bowlers</i>, and countless other never-before-seen stunts have left bowlers, and by extension, even commentators dangerously breathless and short of words. Unquestionably, with his ability to maneuvre the field, his excellent hand-eye co-ordination, and his ability to cause the illusion that the bowler has bowled a poor ball, makes him a revolutionary in the modern game. <br/>  <br/> Case in point: On January 18, 2015, de Villiers smashed the West Indies bowlers to all corners of Johannesburg (and perhaps a few just about clearing the area code) en route to a record 31-ball 100 against a hapless West Indies line-up, beating the previous best in ODIs by <i>five deliveries</i>. The 44-ball 149 (yes, you read that right) included 9 fours and 16 sixes - it only took him 44 balls to equal Rohit Sharma's record tally of 16 sixes in an ODI. Donning the pink jersey, AB milked the bowlers in an unparalleled display of butchery.  <br/>  <br/> AB de Villiers took 11 catches against Pakistan in Johannesburg in the 2012-13 season, equalling the record for most number of catches by a wicket-keeper in a Test match. He shares the record with former England keeper, Jack Russell. He also scored an unbeaten 103 in South Africa's second innings, becoming the first wicket-keeper to score a century and claim 10 dismissals in a Test. His batting antics coupled with his ability to pull off incredible catches and run-outs, and his cat-like reflexes on the field, make him one of the most valuable players in the modern game.   <br/>  <br/> In December 2013, at the peak of his powers, de Villiers became the ninth batsman to top the batting rankings in both Tests and ODIs. He also had a wonderful three-match Test series against Australia, where he finished as the second highest run-scorer. He continued to do well in both Tests and ODIs and ended 2014 as the second-highest run-getter for South Africa in both formats, behind his team-mate Amla.  <br/>  <br/> During the 2015 World Cup, in the match against West Indies, de Villiers scored 162 runs off 66 balls leading South Africa to their second highest total in world cup history (408) at the Sydney Cricket Ground. With this feat, he also became the record holder for the fastest 50, 100, and 150 in ODI history. He amassed 482 runs in the tournament and was the third highest run-scorer overall. His team's campaign, though, ended in heartbreak once again, as New Zealand beat the Proteas in a thrilling semi-final in Auckland. <br/>  <br/> In early 2016, de Villiers took over the Test captaincy after Hashim Amla stepped down during the home series against England. However, an elbow surgery meant that this was the only Test series he played in the entire year, and in December, he decided to quit the leadership role, citing the reason that <i>'the interests of the team must always outweigh the interests of any individual.'</i> <br/>  <br/> After recovering from elbow surgery, de Villiers made a return to the limited-overs formats, but preferred to remain unavailable for Test cricket in an attempt to lighten his workload. However, despite sufficient match practice in the lead-up to the Champions Trophy, de Villiers had a torrid tournament as South Africa's tryst with ICC tournaments continued. <br/>  <br/> A well-rested de Villiers made a comeback into the Test side against Zimbabwe in the Boxing Day Test in December 2017. He has made some commendable contributions since then, scoring invaluable (not to mention chanceless) runs on challenging surfaces and playing the gritty accumulator and the spine of the South African batting line-up in the subsequent home series against India and Australia. In the twilight of his career, the ever-so-versatile AB continues to be a vital cog in South Africa's batting line-up - one without whom, they would be a more fragile unit. With proven credentials in all conditions, pressure situations, and across all formats, AB de Villiers is arguably the most complete batsman of his generation. <br/>  <br/> On May 23, 2018, with just a year to go for the 2019 World Cup, AB de Villiers announced a shock retirement from international cricket with immediate effect. 'After 114 Test matches, 228 ODIs and 78 T20 Internationals, it is time for others to take over. I have had my turn, and to be honest, I am tired,' de Villiers said in his sign-off from international cricket. <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> What would have been the Indian Premier League if not for the presence of South Africa's Superman, AB de Villiers? The 360 degree batsman is a crowd favourite - not just at the M Chinnaswamy stadium, but anywhere across the cricketing world. One of the few players who has been part of the extravaganza, right from its inception in 2008, it was only when he joined the Royal Challengers - ahead of the 2011 edition, that he truly became a fan favourite. It doesn't mean that he wasn't a success story at the Daredevils - his first IPL franchise where he spent his formative years. When the tournament was shifted to South Africa, owning to general elections in India in 2009, he smashed a superb hundred - 105 against the Chennai Super Kings in Durban.  <br/>  <br/> The early promise of a big future had been laid as de Villiers ended the season as Daredevil's highest run-scorer, with 465 runs at an average of 51.66. A below average season followed in 2010 and that led to the Daredevils parting ways with the dashing batsman. The Royal Challengers saw an opportunity and swooped down to get their target man, happy to break the bank with a 1.1 million dollars deal.  <br/>  <br/> Since the, AB de Villiers has proved that each and every penny spent on him has been money well spent - both on the field and off-field. A crowd-puller, AB combined with India's captain, Virat Kohli, to lead RCB's challenge. He finished as the leading run-getter for his franchise for three seasons and was a constant name in the top-three run-scorers, ever since joining in 2011. While his versatility made him one of the best bats - across all formats of the game, his mere presence has come as a shot in the arm for RCB - who are still in search for their maiden IPL title. Now retired from all international cricket, AB de Villiers could well be the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle as RCB get ready for a shot at the coveted title. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Rishi Roy</b>",

      "bio": "A predator’s eyes, an intimidating sprint to the crease, and a blur of a cherry, barely perceptible to the eye, getting past the bat before the mental faculties can process it, and the sight of mangled and cartwheeling stumps in the aftermath of the batsman’s demise encapsulate the phenomenon of Dale Steyn. One of the more enthralling sights of Test cricket in the 21st century has been Steyn running in full-throttle and clocking 150+, shaping the signature outswinger away from a leg-stump line at will and opening up the batsman’s stance to hit the top of off-stump. A classical front-on action with a release hell-bent upon landing it on a length, furious pace to match it, and a clever mind to complement the brawn, Dale Steyn has been one of the most complete fast bowlers of his generation.  <br/>  <br/> Steyn made his Test debut in 2004, along with a fellow rookie by the name of AB de Villiers, after he impressed Ray Jennings with his raw pace and stamina, in the home series against England after a combined experience of just 7 first-class games. A humbling loss on debut set him back as he picked up just 3 wickets in the game, although it included a ripper of an outswinger to knock over Michael Vaughan in the second innings. After a tally of just 8 wickets in the 3-Test series, Steyn failed to make a significant impact and was dropped from the side.  <br/>  <br/> After a slew of impressive first-class performances, Steyn continued to be in the radar and made a comeback in 2006 for the home series against New Zealand. Wary of not getting another chance, Steyn made his mark immediately with a five-for in his first Test, and bowled with more accuracy and vigour than the rookie 2 years earlier. He picked up 16 wickets in 3 Test matches and tormented the Kiwis with his wrecker-in-chief, Makhaya Ntini. Steyn continued to wreck oppositions and was named one of South Africa’s five cricketers of the year. Despite the honor of this accolade, due to the competition for fast bowlers in the side, Steyn found himself out of the reckoning at the beginning of 2007, citing the reason that he did not possess the intensity required off a fast bowler.  <br/>  <br/> Upon his second coming, Steyn was now a full-time version of the monster we had only glimpsed over the years. When another opportunity came knocking, an away tour in Pakistan, Steyn bumped up his pace and fizzled out nine Pakistani batsmen who didn’t know what had struck them. In the subsequent home series against New Zealand, Steyn picked up two 10-wicket hauls and nailed his spot in the side. The one moment that really made the world sit up was his bouncer to Craig Cummin, who was hospitalised after a bouncer from a rampant Dale Steyn crashed into his helmet. After 3 years of ousters from the side and an anxious wait in the fringes, it was the age of Dale Steyn.  <br/>  <br/> There was no looking back after that. In his prime as a fast bowler, Steyn picked up a scarcely believable 86 wickets in 14 games in 2008, earning him the prestigious ICC Player of the Year award in 2008. After stalwarts like Makhaya Ntini and Shaun Pollock called it a day, Steyn went on to form a lethal opening partnership with Morne Morkel. With all the seaming goodness from a giraffe’s height from one end, and the rapid swinging thunderbolts from another, the two formed, arguably, the most fearsome bowling pair-up of the generation.  <br/>  <br/> Steyn’s climb up to the higher echelon of fast bowling was alarming, particularly in statistical terms, as he rubbed shoulders with fast-bowling legends across generations. For instance, he became the fastest Protea to 100 Test wickets and ended up with 249 wickets at the end of his 48th Test, second only to Dennis Lillee in the race for the fastest bowler to 250 Test wickets. His Test strike-rate is particularly astonishing, and remains second only to George Lohmann of England, who played way back in the 19th century. He was the fourth South African bowler to reach the 300-wicket mark as well, after Pollock, Ntini, and Donald, and was easily the fastest to the landmark out of the four.  <br/>  <br/> Steyn’s crowning achievement, however, will not be a World Cup triumph or a glitzy T20 league win; it’ll be his contribution in a South African Test side that dominated overseas in a generation when home series were starting to become more and more one-sided. After a decimation of Australia in the world’s toughest backyard in 2009, he produced an outstanding spell of reverse-swing in the away tour against India to pick-up 7-51 on a flat wicket in Nagpur, to deliver a South African victory as the visitors went 1-0 up in the series, only for India to make a comeback and tie the series in Kolkata with a thrilling last-session victory. South Africa went onto dominate in the tour of England in 2012 and won 2-0, as Steyn unsurprisingly topped the wicket charts with 15 scalps in 3 games. At the pinnacle of their Test game, South Africa received the Test Championship mace after this victory and became the highest-ranked Test side in the world, taking over from England.  <br/>  <br/> After almost 6 years at the peak of his powers, Steyn’s body was starting to break down, unfortunately for South Africa, in the middle of another ICC tournament (the Champion’s Trophy of 2013) as he was ruled out with a groin strain. His tryst with injuries continued, with a fractured rib, a side-strain, and multiple hamstring strains.  <br/>  <br/> However, amidst all the injury concerns, even the crippled warrior managed to be a force on the international stage. In late 2013, when India toured South Africa, Steyn went through the longest wicketless phase in the first Test at Johannesburg, but came back to skittle the Indians with a five-for in Durban as South Africa clinched the series 1-0.  <br/>  <br/> In the subsequent home series against Australia, Steyn bowled a phenomenal spell in the second Test but an injury midway through the 3rd made him a liability as Australia went on to win the series 2-1, highlighting the extent of Steyn’s performances on South Africa’s fortunes. He was also fit in time for the series in Sri Lanka as he played a major role in South Africa’s first series win in Sri Lanka in more than 20 years - another feather in the cap for Steyn and South Africa, another away Test series triumph.  <br/>  <br/> His colossal achievements in Test cricket and South Africa’s reputation in ICC tournaments often understates Steyn’s effectiveness in white-ball cricket. He has prioritised Test cricket over the years but has bowled in some key moments in the limited-overs format too. <br/>  <br/> Steyn has been a key bowler for his franchises in the Indian Premier League as well, churning out wonderful bowling spells, first with Bangalore and later for the Hyderabad franchise. He was also retained by the Hyderabad team during the 2014 auction. <br/>  <br/> In late 2015, Steyn was in the first XI on the tour to India, but he picked up a groin injury in the first Test, and missed the rest of the series. Consequently, South Africa’s reign in away Test series broke after 9 incredible years as they were steamrolled by India 3-0 in a low-scoring tour full of dustbowls. Steyn had another plethora of injuries as he missed most of the series against England, but made a comeback in mid-2016 for the series against New Zealand, before breaking down with an injured shoulder during the Australia tour.  <br/>  <br/> Steyn went on to break the 400-wicket barrier in 2017, and equalled Shaun Pollock’s tally of 421 Test wickets by the end of the short 2-Test away series against Sri Lanka in 2018, as spinners made merry on two custom-made dustbowls. Earlier that year, he got injured after the first Test against India as South Africa went on to win 2-1, and unfortunately couldn’t be in the field to celebrate South Africa’s first home series win against Australia after readmission amidst the chaotic ball-tampering controversy.  <br/>  <br/> The fearsome bowler is in his mid-thirties and is perhaps in the twilight of his career. With his 30s being marred with injuries, he is recuperating from yet another one, as he looks to sign off from Test cricket with one last hurrah, and perhaps dreams of a comeback for the World Cup of 2019 too, with the objective of finally handing South Africa an ICC tournament win, shake off the chokers’ tag for good, and perhaps execute one final chainsaw celebration without fearing for his shoulder.  <br/>  <br/> The disappointment of having missed out the 2019 World Cup made Steyn realise that he has to pick up his playing days going forward and hence he decided to retire from Test cricket as he had an eye on the T20 World Cup in 2020. He signed up in the Big Bash League 2019-20 for the Melbourne Stars and continued his alliance with Cape Town Blitz in the Mzansi Super League.   <br/>  <br/> <b>World Cup through the years..</b> <br/>  <br/> When Dale Steyn and World Cup are mentioned in the same sentence then the only thing that comes to mind is Grant Elliott smashing a six off the penultimate ball of the match to knock South Africa out. A veteran of two World Cups but Steyn has not quite lived up to his billing in the mega events. Yes, he averages 23.39 and has picked up 23 wickets in 14 games, but he has gone missing when South Africa have needed him the most. In almost same number of matches and across two World Cups, Imran Tahir and Morne Morkel have got more wickets than South Africa's premier fast bowler. <br/>  <br/> South Africa have been knocked out twice in two World Cups by New Zealand - 2011 in a quarterfinal and 2015 in a semifinal. In 2011, Steyn picked up 2 for 42 in his 10 overs but was outbowled by Tahir (2/35) and Morkel (3/46) on a slow surface. In the next edition, he had gone for 65 in his 8 overs and was still entrusted to bowl the final over with 12 to defend, he failed to do so as the pair of Daniel Vettori and Elliott finished the game with a ball to spare. <br/>  <br/> This upcoming 2019 edition gives Steyn one last chance to prove his mettle on the world stage. He has not played much cricket of late but like before he does not have the burden of the leading the pace attack. The job for Steyn would be that of a mentor to the likes of Rabada and Ngidi. However, an injury during the warm-ups robbed him of his last chance.",

      "bio": "Of Indian origin - his grandparents migrated to South Africa from Gujarat - Hashim Amla is one of the finest stroke-makers in the game. His supple wrists are a delight to watch, especially when he stands up tall to play those forcing shots off the back-foot, or when he is tucking it off his pads nonchalantly through the on side.  <br/>  <br/> He was appointed captain of his state side - the Nashua Dolphins - at the tender age of 21 and soon impressed everyone with his demeanour. Earmarked as a special talent right from his young age, he led the South African side at the 2002 Under-19 World Cup and made his Test debut against India in 2004-05.  <br/>  <br/> Questions were asked about his mental framework when his talent didn't translate into runs. His technique was thought to be suspect and a couple of failures only reinforced that belief. He was dropped from the side after the initial setbacks and went back to his domestic side and amassed runs to make a comeback. He made a career-saving 149 against New Zealand in Cape Town which ensured a draw.  <br/>  <br/> Now, that knock gave him the self-belief that he could succeed at the international level and runs flowed from his blade. An unbelievable tour of India, where he was dismissed only once in three innings even as the Indians threw everything at him, proved to the world that Amla was the next big thing in world cricket. His run-tally of 490 runs in three innings at an average of 490 in a two Test match series was just simply out-of-the-world stuff.  <br/>  <br/> Despite his magnificent record in Tests, he was always thought to be unsuitable to to the shorter formats of the game, but he proved that wrong by making two hundreds when the Proteas toured the West Indies in 2010 for a five-match ODI series. That performance ensured a permanent place in the South African ODI squad and he was given a chance in T20Is as well.  <br/>  <br/> After Smith resigned from the ODI captaincy when the 2011 World Cup ended, Amla was expected to succeed him, but he chose not to assume the captaincy mantle. He was named the vice-captain of the ODI side.  <br/>  <br/> In 2012, he slammed a triple hundred by scoring 311 against England at The Oval and in the process became the first South African to score a triple century. Amla had a slight dip in form during the end of 2013, where he did not score runs on a consistent basis, but he came back with a bang as he scored a fluent hundred against the touring Australians in the second Test in Port Elizabeth. He also played a major role in getting South Africa to the semi-final of the 2014 World T20, where he scored 185 runs in five innings.  <br/>  <br/> Amla continued to pile on the runs as in the ODI series in Sri Lanka, he scored back-to-back hundreds, before notching up one more in Zimbabwe. In fact, he finished 2014 as South Africa's highest run-getter in both Tests and ODIs. He also smashed a double hundred against West Indies in December 2014.  <br/>  <br/> 2015 wasn't the greatest year for Amla. He had an average World Cup by his standards, and even his Test form dipped. Captaining a Test team in transition, after Graeme Smith's retirement in mid-2014, it proved to be a struggle for him. The tour of India during the winter further aggravated his misery as South Africa were blown away in the Test matches. Not long after that, early in the new year, Amla resigned as captain. <br/>  <br/> The resignation came during the series against England at home, after he had slammed a double hundred in the first Test at Cape Town.  <br/>  <br/> While his Test form may have dipped slightly, Amla remained prolific as ever in ODIs, becoming the fastest player to 7000 ODI runs in 2017. He also holds the record for being the fastest ever to 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000 ODI runs - which is a testament to his astonishing levels of consistency. <br/>  <br/> Despite not being known as a power-hitter, Amla has also excelled at T20 cricket. He finished sixth on the list of top run-getters in IPL 2017 - a season in which he smashed two hundreds. <br/>  <br/> World Cup through the years..  <br/>  <br/> The mighty Hash as he is known as has not lived up to his reputation when it comes to World Cups. He scored 306 runs in the 2011 edition at an average of 43.71 including a hundred against Netherlands and a crucial fifty versus India in the chase of 298. However, Amla failed to deliver when it mattered - quarterfinal against New Zealand - he got cheaply for 7 when South Africa were chasing a target of 222. <br/>  <br/> The 2015 tournament was almost on similar lines - in excess of 300 runs and an average over 40 but he went missing when it came to the big game - semifinal versus New Zealand. Amla scored only 10 and with de Kock also having a poor World Cup, the onus was left on AB de Villiers and Co. to bail them out of troubled waters. They did manage to score 281 but New Zealand overhauled it off the penultimate ball. <br/>  <br/> Amla's form has not been great leading into the 2019 World Cup. Questions were raised when he was selected in the first place and they will be asked when he is picked in the XI as well, but great players always have a knack of silencing everyone. The tournament in England and Wales might just be the one Amla has been waiting for to allow his bat do the talking. For South Africa to have a good World Cup Amla's form at the top will be important.",

      "bio": "Francois du Plessis, fondly known as Faf, is South Africa's captain cool that might never have been. Having signed a Kolpak deal with Lancashire, Faf had initially decided to go the way of professional cricket. However, as fate would have it, the implementation of a new immigration policy resulted in du Plessis being unable to fulfill his duties as a Kolpak player. <br/>  <br/> Upon his return to the South African fold, he had a prolific season in 2010 for the Titans (567 runs in 10 matches) in the MTN Pro40 competition, including three centuries in as many matches as he started to knock on the doors of the national selectors. <br/>  <br/> Du Plessis's calm and composed approach at the center ensured that he was a perfect fit for international cricket - especially in a side that has had the 'chokers' label sticking to them since long. An orthodox, all-conditions technique and a dogged approach at the crease makes him an asset in the age of T20 cricket. Moreover, his ability to strike it big is a testament to the versatility of the man. After marking his ODI debut against India with a composed 50 in January 2011, he continued his good form in the World Cup, notably steering his side to victory in a high-pressure run-chase against eventual World Champions, India. <br/>  <br/> After a long wait for the coveted Test cap, du Plessis was finally awarded a place in the side on the tour to Australia. And then it happened. The career-defining knock. In Adelaide, under immense pressure in the world's toughest backyard, du Plessis showed immense grit and antiquated resolve with AB de Villiers to snatch a thrilling draw on the final day, indirectly leading them to a phenomenal series win and handing South Africa the ICC Test Championship mace. <br/>  <br/> Thereafter, du Plessis continued to be an immovable figure in the South African line-up: one of the big three (Amla, de Villiers, and Faf) most coveted wickets for the opposition. He led by example in the shortest format too (although silverware continued to elude them) with a semifinal finish in the 2014 edition of World T20 and a superb 2015 World Cup campaign which famously ended in heart-break for the South Africans. Nevertheless, barring the ICC tournaments and the India tour of 2015, South Africa continued to do well across formats; especially abroad, in an age of fortress domination. <br/>  <br/> After a form slump in Tests, du Plessis was dropped for the start of the England series in 2016, as his school-friend AB de Villiers took over captaincy from Hashim Amla. However, citing injury and workload issues, de Villiers stepped down from his role in December. du Plessis, long believed to be the natural successor for the job, had found his run-scoring mojo and was filling in as deputy skipper. He even led South Africa to a famous Test series win in November against Australia in their own backyard and was named permanent Test captain of South Africa with immediate effect. <br/>  <br/> With AB de Villiers stepping down half-way through 2017 as ODI captain, following a disastrous Champions Trophy campaign, Faf du Plessis was appointed the captain of South Africa across formats. <br/>  <br/> <b>World Cup - Through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> They say timing is everything in sport. It was timing that didn't allow Faf to go to England as a Kolpak player and it was again timing that got him a ticket for the 2011 World Cup in India. After marking his ODI debut against India with a composed 50 in January 2011, he continued his good form in the World Cup, notably steering his side to victory in a high-pressure run-chase against eventual World Champions, India. <br/>  <br/> However, Faf is more known for running out his best mate AB de Villiers in the quarterfinal against New Zealand. The game was in the balance and de Villiers was set on 35 when Faf called him for a risky single. That wicket changed the course of the game and South Africa fell apart in their pursuit of 222. The C-word was once again thrown around. <br/>  <br/> In 2015, Faf scored 380 runs and was only second to AB de Villiers for South Africa's leading run scorers. Even in the heartbreaking 2015 semi final against New Zealand, Faf was the top scorer with 82. However, he could not prevent his country from being knocked out as Dale Steyn failed to defend 12 runs off the final over. Another World Cup and another opportunity missed. <br/>  <br/> The 2019 edition saw Faf lead South Africa for the first time in the mega event. However, the Proteas had a forgettable tournament as they managed to win only three of their nine matches. Faf, personally, had a decent World Cup with the bat. He was the only South African to feature in the top-20 run-getters list. Faf amassed 387 runs in eight innings, which included a match-winning century against Australia in the final round-robin game of the tourney.  <br/>  <br/> The right-hander retired from Test cricket at the end of the Pakistan series in February, 2021, and announced his intentions to play white-ball cricket for South Africa. However, his views weren't accepted by the board and he hasn't been part of the white-ball team since then, instead travelling across the global circuits in various T20 leagues.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> Even before he became a regular for South Africa, Faf had managed to be a trusted figure in the CSK dug-out. He may not have always been a regular starter due to the abundance of matchwinners that the franchise had in the overseas category. However, they knew that in times of crisis, Faf was the man they could always turn to. The 2018 season is one such example, when he rescued the side from the dumps in the Qualifier-1 with a nerveless innings, thereby piloting them to the final.  Du Plessis then became a vital cog in CSK's plans and played a big role in their 2021 title triumph. Having been let go by the franchise ahead of the 2022 auctions, he was snapped up by the Royal Challengers Bangalore, who promptly announced him as their captain, leading the team to a playoff finish and was retained as captain for the following season.

      "bio": "Every once in a while, usually a very long while, there comes a player who manages to capture your imagination. Quinton de Kock is one such talent from South Africa. Some of the feats which he has accomplished at his age are unfathomable and it's easy to see why he was being heralded as a future great. Not only is de Kock one heck of a batsman, but the value he brings to the side by donning the gloves is tremendous. But de Kock’s story in international cricket has panned out to be a collection of what-ifs.   <br/>  <br/> De Kock went to King Edward VII High School, the same school which Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie attended. He rose to prominence as part of the South Africa U-19 side and ended up as his team's highest run-scorer during the 2012 U-19 World Cup in Australia. Later that year, playing for the Lions in the Champions League T20, de Kock caught the eye of a larger audience with a sparkling knock to help his team over the line against Mumbai Indians. <br/>  <br/> It paved the way for him to make it to the national team in a T20I series against New Zealand two months later, as AB de Villiers wanted a break. However, international success didn't come early for de Kock. It was only a year later, when he scored those three successive ODI hundreds against India, that people started taking notice of his humongous talent. <br/>  <br/> He was pretty much in and out of the side for the rest of the year until he came up against once more and solidified his position with a couple of hundreds in a five-match ODI series. <br/>  <br/> He didn't have a memorable 2015 World Cup as an ankle injury threatened to jeopardize de Kock's participation. But the then 22-year-old made it back in time for the mega event. His form though eluded him right through the tournament. Opening the innings for South Africa, he crossed the score of 20 just twice in eight matches. <br/> At this point, it had been a little under two years of de Kock making his Test debut. He never really made the spot his own. Despite the ODI success in India, Dane Vilas was chosen over him to be the wicketkeeper in the following Test series. However, it was the year 2016 which de Kock truly made his own and produced performances which would go on to evoke comparisons with a legend like Adam Gilchrist. <br/>  <br/> Hitting a purple patch during the middle of the year, de Kock became the fifth South African to score five fifty-plus scores in a row, a streak which culminated with a match-winning hundred against Australia at Hobart which sealed the series for the visitors. De Kock's style of play in the previous Test at Perth, where he made counter-attacking fifties, followed by Hobart, revived great memories of their own legendary wicketkeeper batsman for many Australian supporters. <br/>  <br/> Not just the Test format, de Kock thrived in limited-overs cricket too in 2016. He started off with a couple of hundreds against England at home before emerging as South Africa's highest run-getter in the World T20 to be named in the ICC's team of the tournament. Later in the year, he played perhaps his most memorable ODI knock to date as he destroyed Australia with a during a 113-ball 178 at Centurion. <br/> In a series against Bangladesh in 2017, de Kock shared an unbeaten 282-run partnership with Hashim Amla and it became a record for the highest opening partnership in ODI cricket. De Kock continued to flourish in South African colors and with the retirement of some of their legends like AB de Villiers, he became an even more vital part of their lineup. He was part of South Africa’s squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup but had middling returns with 305 runs from 8 games.  <br/>  <br/> De Kock’s skill set and consistency made him a highly sought after player in the world of franchise cricket. By 2021, he’d already played for four different IPL teams and had already won two titles with the Mumbai Indians. As T20 contracts grew more lucrative, de Kock was signed by teams in The Hundred, CPL, MLC and the SA20. With so many commitments on his plate, to the shock and disappointment of many, de Kock announced his retirement from Test cricket in December 2021 aged just 29.  <br/>  <br/> He was a part of South Africa’s 2021 T20 World Cup squad but landed in controversy when he made himself unavailable for selection for their game against the West Indies after refusing to take the knee. De Kock later apologized and clarified his position and went on to take the knee and play the rest of the games. He was also a part of the following 2022 T20 World Cup and had middling returns. <br/>   <br/> In 2023, de Kock was named in South Africa’s squad for the Cricket World Cup but he shocked the world once again saying he would retire from ODI cricket after the conclusion of the tournament. Citing reasons of wanting to spend more time with his family and that it was “time to get a final top-up in T20 leagues” as he entered what he called the “slope of his career”. This meant that de Kock’s sole focus rested on T20 cricket now, both international and franchise. De Kock made himself available for the 2023 edition of the BBL.  <br/> ",

      "bio": "It's generally the young tearaway pacers that make headlines solely for their fiery speed and intimidating bounce. Kagiso Rabada is as close as it gets to an 'optimum combination'. So when 20-year-old Kagiso Rabada made his debut against India in November 2015, the general consensus was the usual <i>\"great potential if honed suitably\"</i>. What followed was a pleasant surprise for the South African team - a prodigy who assured them with his performances that the future of the nation's fast bowling was in good hands. <br/> Rewind to the 2014 Under-19 World Cup: the name Rabada came into the limelight as he brutalized the Australian line-up with a spell of 6/25, constantly hitting the mid-140s. After propelling his side to the final of the tournament with his miserly and penetrative bowling, he ended the tournament as his side's highest wicket-taker. His astonishing performances did not go unnoticed as he was awarded a contract with the Highveld Lions upon his return to South Africa with the elusive Cup of glory. <br/>  <br/> Under the mentorship of Gordon Parsons, Chris Morris and Lonwabo Tsotsobe in the Lions, the quick-learner rose rapidly through the ranks and soon found himself traveling to Australia with the South Africa A side. His hunger for progress did not stop as he continued to catch the eye of the selectors, getting his first international opportunity in a T20 match against Australia in November 2014. He had a good outing, picking up the wicket of Glenn Maxwell on debut. His ODI debut followed shortly after against Bangladesh and immediately rewrote the history books, taking a hat-trick against a clueless Bangladesh side and ending up with 6 for 16 - the best bowling figures of all time on ODI debut. <br/>  <br/> An injury-stricken Steyn presented Rabada with bowling opportunities in the tour of India in 2015. He stole the show immediately in ODIs, bowling with maturity far beyond his years, and notably keeping last-over specialist MS Dhoni in check with 5 dots in the final over of the Indore ODI, and making a celebrated Indian line-up uncomfortable. Consequently, he was handed a Test debut during the Test series that followed in India. He didn't quite make the red SG ball talk as much as he did the Kookaburra. The dustbowls didn't help much either, as South Africa resorted to bowling their spinners far more than the pacers, rendering the young seam bowler futile. <br/>  <br/> Nevertheless, with the Dukes ball in hand, Rabada announced himself on the green seamers in England, consistently flummoxing the hapless Englishmen and ending the tour with a flabbergasting three five-wicket hauls in six innings. Having achieved the near impossible task of filling the shoes of arguably the greatest fast bowler in the world, Rabada marched on and played a major role in South Africa's 2-1 drubbing of the Australians in their own backyard. <br/> Rabada is armed with the ability to swing the ball conventionally, though he prefers to make it seam off the wicket with the scrambled seam deliveries, especially when the seam is prominent and likely to cause deviations off the surface. He also possesses the pace to reverse-swing the ball against the direction of the seam, with the old ball and new, and has already wreaked havoc with the old ball several times in his brief Test career. At such a young age, these skills and the control and consistency he bowls with makes him a valuable asset to the South African side - one worth counting on in the long run. <br/>  <br/> His on-field conduct, however, has been questionable, as he has been accused and reprimanded for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct multiple times, and even copped a ban (which was then reversed upon appeal) in the 2018 home series against Australia for shouldering Steven Smith on his way to celebrating the latter's wicket with his team-mates. He ended up picking up 11 wickets in the match and single-handedly drew level with Australia 1-1 after a gutting loss in the first Test. <br/>  <br/> South Africa's efforts to contest the charges against Rabada exhibited the value of the young man in the team. With a limited Philander, an injured Steyn, and an aging Morkel (playing his final series), Rabada has become the linchpin in the South African bowling line-up. All of 22 years old, and having already carved himself an image in the international arena, Rabada looked like a focused individual who could scale inconceivable heights in future, barring any major injuries. <br/>  <br/> He was their strike bowler for the 2019 World Cup, but that was a tournament where South Africa largely underperformed. Post the World Cup, with Morkel and Steyn retiring, Rabada seamlessly filled into their shoes and formed a good partnership with the new crop of pacers like Anrich Nortje, Lungi Ngidi and Marco Jansen. <br/>  <br/> KG has been a consistent performer for South Africa irrespective of the formats, with bowling averages under 30 in both Tests and ODI cricket. In the 2021 T20I World Cup, Rabada became the first South African bowler to pick a hat-trick in that format as he achieved that feat against England. In 2022, he picked up an inspired fifer at Lord’s in a Test match, paving the way for South Africa to become the first team to dent England’s Bazball revolution. <br/> Still fairly young with an incredible fitness record, Kagiso Rabada’s glass ceiling could be really, really high if he can keep performing this way for South Africa. <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL Through the Years</b> <br/>  <br/> The rise of Rabada had certainly caught a few eyes by this point as he fetched Rs. 5 crore at the IPL auction in 2017, to play for Delhi Daredevils, and for 4.2 crore at the 2019 auction as the Daredevils used their RTM card to retain their bowling jewel. Rabada and Delhi Capitals were synonymous for a long time, as he proved to be a dependable performer in the competition. <br/>  <br/> Bowling two upfront and two in the death, Rabada was generally a wicket bank for Delhi. He picked 25 wickets in the 2019 season, and bettered that with 30 wickets in the 2020 season - claiming the Purple Cap as DC reached the finals for the first time. Rabada’s wickets tally took a hit in the 2021 season, as he could only manage 15 wickets. With this poor return and also a worrying economy rate, and the growing popularity of countryman Anrich Nortje, Delhi Capitals decided to let KG go ahead of the 2022 IPL mega auction, paving the way for Punjab Kings to swoop in and pick up for a lofty price. Rabada continues to be a dependable wicket-taker in the competition, but his rising economy rate and an inability to nail the yorker with the same potency has been a cause for concern.",

      "bio": "Perhaps the greatest all-rounder of all time and certainly the best in recent times, Jacques Kallis' stats in all forms of the game makes for jaw-dropping stuff. The only man to have scored over 10000 runs and taken over 250 wickets in both forms of the game, Kallis is a modern day colossus. Add a couple of hundred catches in both forms of the game and what you get is an invaluable and an irreplaceable asset. <br/>  <br/> Kallis made his test debut in 1995 against England and in only his seventh test, he produced a match-saving hundred against Australia at the MCG, where he thwarted off the likes of Warne and McGrath to prove his class. With that knock, Kallis fulfilled his promise and has been the rock that holds the South African middle-order together for nearly 15 years. <br/>  <br/> Technically sound and strong off either foot, Kallis is adept at playing both the seamers and the spinners. Once in, he is one of the most difficult batsman to dislodge in World Cricket and has often buried the opposition into dust with his stoic approach at the crease. Though his primary emphasis is on defence, he is always on the lookout for runs and is severe on anything loose. He can play practically every shot in the book, though his cover drives are his best. <br/>  <br/> His critics have often pointed out that Kallis' is a selfish batsman and that he puts his interests above the team's. But Kallis' record in both forms of the game and his efforts in shoring up a weak South African middle-order in the early millennium have comprehensively dispelled those notions. <br/>  <br/> A wonderful safe pair of hands wherever he fields, Kallis is seen fielding at slips and has taken some outstanding catches. With the ball in his hand, he was pretty quick during the early phase of his career when his swing bowling was well utilised by Cronje. But he gradually reduced his bowling work-load due to a sore back and of late only bowls when required. He is considered to be a partnership breaker and often the ball has been thrown to him to produce that vital breakthrough. <br/>  <br/> Jacques Kallis played for the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the first three seasons and was picked up  by the Kolkata Knight Riders during the latest auctions. Having maintained impeccable fitness right throughout his career, Kallis at 35, looks set to continue for a couple of years more and is all set to break whatever records that are within his reach. With a burning desire to be a part of a World Cup winning South African side, Kallis requested the team management to allow him to skip the shorter format of the game, with a view to maintain himself ahead of the 2015 WC in Australia and New Zealand. As such, Kallis did not feature in an ODI match from February, 2012 to November 2013. <br/>  <br/> Having already achieved greatness, Kallis would love to go out of the game on a high, and with a World Cup medal around his neck. <br/>  <br/> On December 25th, 2013, he announced his retirement from Test cricket at the end of the Boxing Day Test against India. <br/>  <br/> Having realised that his dream of playing in the 2015 was a 'bridge too far', he quit all forms of international cricket after an unproductive ODI series against Sri Lanka in July 2014. However, he will continue to play for Sydney Thunder in the BBL, and Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. <br/>   <br/> <b>Interesting facts:</b> He has been described by Kevin Pietersen and Daryll Cullinan as the greatest cricketer to play the game. <br/>  <br/> Kallis is one of only four players in Test history (after Sir Donald Bradman and before Mohammad Yousuf, Gautam Gambhir) to make a century in five consecutive matches, achieved in season 2003/04. <br/>   <br/> The Jacques Kallis Scholarship Foundation was established in Kallis' benefit year with the aim of combining the academic and life skills programmes of existing school structures with funding and mentoring support from Jacques Kallis.  Currently, the Jacques Kallis Scholarship Foundation sponsors 2 boys from Pretoria Boys High School, 2 from Maritzburg College and 2 from Selborne College. Jacques Kallis partakes in annual fundraising events for his Foundation, to which he invites fellow South African celebrities and cricketers like Mark Boucher and Andre Nel. <br/>  <br/> Shamone Jardim is Jacques Kallis' girlfriend and is a Star model from Cape Town and the two have been dating for four long years now. She qualifies as one of the hottest WAGs in international cricket. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Srivathsa</b>",

      "bio": "Tall, well built and known as the 'Biff' for his ability to smash the leather off the ball, Graeme Smith was thrust into the captaincy duties at a very young age. In fact he was handed the reins at 22 - which made him his country's youngest captain and tasked with restoring the faith of his countrymen after Hansie Cronje had ripped whatever was remaining with his immoral hand in the match fixing scandal. Smith took over the reigns from Shaun Pollock after the 2003 World Cup and immediately set about rebuilding the side. <br/>  <br/> The tour of England in 2003 made Smith's name. He made consecutive double hundreds and his 259 remains the highest score by a foreigner at Lord's.  Smith finished the series with an aggregate of 714 runs at an average of 79.33, and ended up as the joint Man of the Series. <br/>  <br/> Smith's captaincy as well as his batting mirror his personality; strong, demonstrative and outwardly aggressive. As with all left handers, he is strong off the pads and will punish the loose ones on the off side with equal felicity. Though he may not look elegant as most lefties do, Smith is a relentless attacker and scores his runs quickly thereby giving his side the chance to bowl out most teams. <br/>  <br/> As a captain, he leads by example; a case in point being the Sydney test in 2009 when he came out to bat with a broken hand to save the game. He failed to do so, but won unanimous praise for his act of bravery. Often standing at 1st slip, chewing away on his gum, Smith is a brash and impulsive skipper who backs his team to the hilt. He is known to be an aggressive sledger too and has in return copped a fair amount from the Aussies early on when he was new to international cricket. <br/>  <br/> His crowning glory as captain came when he led his side to a famous test series win in Australia during the 2008-09 season and repeated the feat once again in the 2012-13 tour. In fact, 2012 would turn out to be  his most successful year as a captain. Prior to the success against Australia, South Africa crushed the then World No.1 Test team, England to annex the mace themselves. Andrew Strauss, the then England skipper stepped aside and retired from all forms of the game. With his retirement, Smith achieved a rare feat of retiring three (Hussain, Vaughan and Strauss) England captains in three successive tours. <br/>  <br/> Smith became the most successful Test captain of all times when he led his team to a fine victory over Pakistan at Cape Town. This was his 49th Test win as a captain, going past Ricky Ponting, who achieved 48 wins for Australia.  <br/>  <br/> Though he was unable to lead his side to any ICC silverware during his tenure, Smith was one of the most impressive men to have lead South Africa. His captaincy skills have been lauded and praised for the way he resurrected South African cricket after a turbulent phase. <br/>  <br/> Smith quit the ODI captaincy after his side crashed out of the quarterfinals during the ICC World Cup in 2011. He still remains the test captain though and has said that he wants to guide the next generation of youngsters as he prepares to leave behind a legacy. Smith played for the Rajasthan Royals under Shane Warne during the first three seasons of the IPL. His relationship with Warne changed as they discovered more about each other and became friends; where once Warne and Smith had a verbal war during the latter's early career. <br/>  <br/> Smith retired from international cricket, he took the decision on the third day of the third Test against Australia in March 2014. He forwarded the news to his team-mates on the very same day. The main reason was the lack of form as he scored only 45 runs in six innings that he played in the series. Smith also said that retirement was always on the back of his mind as he had a young family and wanted to spend more time with them. However, Smith had signed a contract with Surrey last year and will continue to play for them in the upcoming County Championship. <br/>  <br/> <b>Interesting facts about Graeme Smith:</b> Graeme Smith dated a swimsuit model, Minki van der Westhuizen in his early international days. <br/>  <br/> He is married to Irish singer Morgan Deane. Together they have two kids, one daughter named Candence and a son born recently named Carter.  <br/>  <br/> Smith is on Twitter @GraemeSmith49. He is very active on the social network and is constantly in touch with his team-mates. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Srivathsa and Akshay Maanay</b> <br/> <i>As of April 2014</i>",

      "bio": "Morne Morkel is one of those big, tall fast bowlers who can intimidate batsmen with pace and bounce. He is the younger brother of Albie Morkel, who has also played Tests and ODIs for South Africa.  <br/>  <br/> Morkel made his Test debut against India in 2006 at the Kingsmead in Durban and emerged as a frontline bowler for the Proteas in a short span of time. The fact that he burst onto the scene when the likes of Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini were past their prime helped him establish his position in the team.  <br/>  <br/> He was constantly monitored by Allan Donald, which did him a world of good. His ability to hit the deck hard and generate extra bounce at a searing pace has been amongst the primary reasons for his success. He has had his share of injury worries, but his gifted ability to extract awkward bounce from a length at good pace has meant that he has always been a part of the South African bowling attack.  <br/>  <br/> A brief stint with Kent in 2007 helped him get a berth in the inaugural World T20, wherein he had all the top-order batsmen hopping and unable to counter his pace and bounce.  <br/>  <br/> In October 2008, him and Albie became the first brothers in 56 years to be named as South African Cricket Annual Cricketers of the Year in the same season. The stint with Kent was followed by a season with Yorkshire in 2008, a season which helped him reinvent himself as a bowler, being bred on green tops. He was picked for South Africa's tour to Australia in December 2008 on the basis of the form he displayed in county cricket, but to everyone's dismay he flattered to deceive, dishing out some insipid bowling spells. <br/>  <br/> He was once again drafted into the squad for the World T20 in June 2009 in England, where he had moderate success before being overlooked for the Champions Trophy at home. <br/>  <br/> He was then picked for the home series against England, in which his match-winning spell with the ball on the first morning of the fourth Test at Wanderers proved to be decisive, going a long way in helping South Africa win the Test and level the series, thus preventing a complete humiliation at the hands of England, whom they had convincingly beaten on their previous tour in 2008.  <br/>  <br/> After a lackluster 2009, Morkel had his best year in Tests to date. He went on to form a formidable combo with Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander, arguably the best attack in the world for the next 2-3 years. Morkel played his 50th Test against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi. <br/>  <br/> With regards to the IPL, after having little success with Rajasthan, he was picked up by Delhi in 2011 for USD 475,000. He had a moderate first season, where his team finished at the bottom. However, he went on to become the leading wicket-taker in 2012 with 25 sticks, finishing with the purple cap as well. During the 2014 auction, he was picked up by Kolkata. <br/>  <br/> Morkel finished as the leading wicket-taker for South Africa in the 2015 ODI World Cup. In the next one and a half year, he could only make limited appearances as his participation was mostly hindered due to a back injury. He continued to be a force in the Tests though, pairing up with Kagiso Rabada in Dale Steyn's long injury absence to keep delivering the goods for South Africa. <br/>  <br/> He was a part of the an in-form South African side that failed to even make the last four at the 2017 Champions Trophy played in England. Morkel had a disappointed outing himself, going for runs and looking increasingly ineffective against the growing skills of helmeted batsmen on flat pitches. With Ottis Gibson's appointment in the lead to South Africa's conquest for a maiden World Cup win, Morkel sought clarity on his limited-overs future in the face of flying rumours about a potential Kolpak contract and found himself back in the fold on cue. Morkel, though, continues to be fragile with injuries without much progress on the bowling front in limited-overs internationals. He missed the ODIs against Bangladesh due to injury and on return had to endure a demotivating series loss to India in the 6-match rubber. <br/>  <br/> On February 26, 2018, Morne made a surprising decision to quit international cricket post Australia's visit in February-April. He put the decision to retire down to a young family and a demanding international schedule. <br/>  <br/> <b>By Rishi Roy</b>",

      "bio": "In February 2017, at age 37, Imran Tahir reached the pinnacle of limited overs cricket by becoming the No. 1 ranked ODI and T20I bowler in the world. It was a testament to his desire to succeed at the top level, a trait which has helped him defy age and turn it into a complete non-factor. Be it his trademark celebratory sprints after picking a wicket, or the passionately charged roars on the field of play, Tahir's enthusiasm has kept him going. That very love for the game stands out in what has been an unorthodox cricketing career. <br/>  <br/> Tahir was born in Lahore, Pakistan. He learnt his trade in Pakistan. He even went on to represent the Pakistan U-19 team and was also a part of the Pakistan A side on some tours. However, he failed to make the transition to the next stage. Pakistan were blessed with some quality spinners and Tahir never really made his mark at the senior level to warrant a selection.  <br/>  <br/> He was a wise man though. He decided to ply his trade elsewhere. He began playing county cricket in England but did not stay there for long. He made another jump, this time to South Africa. Another wise move, considering South Africa's perennial dearth of quality spinners. He even met his wife, a South African citizen of Indian origin, and settled down in South Africa. <br/>  <br/> He got his first call to the South African Test team in 2010 when England were touring, but it was due to an embarrassing error by the selection committee. Tahir was not eligible to play for South Africa until January, 2011. He was quickly withdrawn from the team then, but found his way back almost immediately after becoming eligible to play.  <br/>  <br/> He made his Test debut against against Australia at Cape Town in November 2011 and since then, he has been a regular part of the squad. In the Test series against Pakistan in UAE in 2013, he was not picked for the first Test, but he came back strongly in the second by bagging a five-wicket haul on the first day of the Test match. Tahir was left out once again after one bad Test with the ball against India and was replaced by Robin Peterson, but he continued to do well in the shorter forms of the game. He was also the highest wicket-taker in the 2014 T20 World Cup, with 12 wickets at an average of 10.91. He continued to be a regular member of the South African side in all formats and played Test matches in spin-friendly conditions.  <br/>  <br/> The variations at Tahir's disposable make him almost impossible to get away in the limited versions of the game, where he has found great success. The same couldn't be said about Test matches though, where batsmen don't feel the need to go after him and where Tahir himself hasn't been at his consistent best. <br/>  <br/> It is impossible to predict where the finish line will be for someone like Tahir, who is still in great shape physically and who has expressed the desire to keep going for as long as he can. South Africa certainly aren't complaining. Meanwhile, Tahir has also achieved success in the various T20 Leagues across the globe, notably the IPL where he has represented Delhi and Chennai. Although he has done well for both franchises, it's the Dhoni-led franchise where he has really unleashed himself as the side's trump card. <br/>  <br/> World Cup through the years..   <br/>  <br/> Tahir made his ODI debut in the 2011 World Cup. He was eligible to play for South Africa in January 2011 and he was immediately selected for the ODI series against India, but was never picked in the playing eleven. Skipper, Graeme Smith, preferred to keep him as a surprise weapon for the World Cup in the subcontinent soon after. He impressed immediately, picking 14 wickets in the five games he played at an average of 10.71. Tahir was part of the quarterfinal game against New Zealand, where he returned with 2 for 32 and still South Africa could not chase down 221. <br/>  <br/> Fast forward four years and Tahir had become a world class bowler. He was not only South Africa's lead spinner, he was also gunning for the top rank in ODIs and T20Is. Tahir achieved the No. 1 ranking in ODIs for the first time in 2015, during the 2015 World Cup. He picked up 15 wickets at 21.53 and was the second highest wicket-taker for South Africa behind Morne Morkel's 17. In that heartbreaking semifinal against New Zealand, Tahir was the most economical bowler - giving away only 40 runs in his 9 overs. <br/>  <br/> In just two editions, Tahir has become the third highest wicket-taker for South Africa in World Cups, behind only Alan Donald and Shaun Pollock. Since he has already announced his retirement after the 2019 tournament, Tahir would have liked to end his international career with a World Cup medal. But like previous tournaments, South Africa underperformed big time in yet another ICC tournament. <br/>  <br/> Interesting fact: South Africa, Dolphins, Easterns, Hampshire, Lahore Blues, Lahore City, Lahore Lions, Lahore Ravi, Lahore Whites, Middlesex, Pakistan A, Pakistan International Airlines, Redco Pakistan Ltd, Sialkot, Staffordshire, Sui Gas Corporation of Pakistan, Titans, Delhi Daredevils, Rising Pune Supergiant, Chennai Super Kings, Warwickshire, Water and Power Development Authority, Yorkshire - these are the teams that Tahir has represented so far in his career.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Sagar Chawla, Ganesh Chandrasekaran and Kiran Nataraj</b>",

      "bio": "Nothing captures the essence of David Miller more than the couple of catchphrases which he himself popularized after setting the IPL on fire in 2013: \"If it's in the V, it's in the tree; if it's in the arc, it's out the park\". He had been around for a while at this point, but this was the season which catapulted him into the next level.  <br/>  <br/> Miller is a left-handed batsman, who is renowned for his power-hitting. He made his debut for the Dolphins at the age of 17 in the 2007-08 season. He averaged only 12.33 in that season as the Dolphins finished fifth. He managed to turn it around in the 2009-10 season when runs flowed from his bat. Although the results did not exactly go in his team's favour, he finished with 374 runs. He was selected in the South Africa 'A' team for a limited overs series against Bangladesh 'A' and he carried on his good form by scoring 195 runs in five games at an average of 65.  <br/>  <br/> His consistent performances earned him a call to the South African national team for the tour of the West Indies in May-June 2010. It was a tough time for South Africa as they had failed to reach the semi-finals in the 2010 World T20. The selectors were on the lookout for fresh faces and Miller was among the players considered. He made his debut in the T20I at North Sound, Antigua.  <br/> South Africa were reeling at 59/5 in the 13th over. Miller stepped in and he showed remarkable composure. He hit his third ball in international cricket for a six and as he smashed 33 off 26 balls. His 57-run stand with Johan Botha helped South Africa reach 120/7. It turned out to be a crucial contribution as South Africa went on to win the match by just one run.  <br/>  <br/> Miller then made his ODI debut against the West Indies and he chipped in with some useful contributions with the bat towards the end of the innings. His good form continued in both the T20Is and ODIs against Zimbabwe in October. During that ODI series, he notched up his first fifty off only 30 balls.  <br/>  <br/> He continued to showcase his talent for Durham in the English domestic circuit. He was a consistent performer with the bat, including a gritty 54 off just 41 balls in a losing cause against Yorkshire. Miller was signed up by Punjab for the 2011 IPL season for a price of $100,000 as a replacement for Dimitri Mascarenhas but did not play in a single game.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Miller's fortunes turned for the better in the 2013 edition of the IPL. Miller was the highest run-getter for Punjab. He scored 418 runs at an average 59.71. He scored three fifties and a hundred. The hundred came off 38 balls against Bangalore and is the third fastest in the IPL. His big-hitting was the talk of the town. Miller was retained by the Punjab side in the 2014 auctions.  <br/>  <br/> After a successful IPL, he was named in the South African squad for the Champions Trophy. Since then, he has been a regular member of the ODI and T20I side. Despite having moderately successful numbers, especially since 2016, Miller has often faced unwarranted criticism. It probably had to do with that reputation which he had built due to his IPL heroics. He isn't a batsman who can tonk from ball one in every game but when set, there are few more dangerous batsmen than this dashing southpaw. Over the years, Miller has realised this and has given himself a bit of time before unleashing. The fact that he came in very early into the national team means that he still has enough time, with one more ODI World Cup in 2023 a realistic possibility. He has started to be more consistent across format and given his style of play, Miller is always a sure starter in limited-overs matches. <br/>  <br/> <b>World Cup through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> David Miller had made his debut just before the 2011 World Cup and had not set the stage on fire. However, he was named in South Africa's preliminary squad but did not make the final cut. By the time the next edition came around in 2015, Miller had cemented his place in the set-up and taken over the role of finisher. He scored 324 runs at an average of 65 and strike rate of 139.  <br/>  <br/> He started the tournament with a bang scoring 138 off just 92 balls against Zimbabwe in South Africa's first game. He put up a 256-run stand along with JP Duminy (115*), the highest partnership for the fifth-wicket in all World Cups. Miller also went on to play a whirlwind cameo in the all-important semifinal against New Zealand, smashing 49 off just 18 balls but still ended up on the losing side. <br/> The 2019 edition, however, wasn’t quite as successful for Miller and South Africa. In the four games he batted, Miller tallied 136 runs and failed to get past 3 while South Africa didn’t make the semi-finals.  <br/>  <br/> He was named in South Africa’s 15-man squad for the 2023 Cricket World Cup India.",

      "bio": "A young prodigy who shot through the ranks, Aiden Markram was a flamboyant stroke-maker from an early age and rose to fame after he had a dream run as captain of South Africa and led them to the U-19 World Cup title.  <br/>  <br/> Having been picked on a selection whim after unimpressive numbers in the lead-up to the tournament, he repaid the faith of the selectors and contributed handsomely to end the tournament as the Proteas’ highest run-scorer and lifted the cup in a nation frustrated and haunted by the c-word. Markram looked confident from the outset - when asked to list three words that best described him, he mentioned ’Positive, confident and responsible,’ and he went on to live up to it in the tournament. <br/>  <br/> However, after being touted as the next 'big thing' in South African cricket, form and consistency deserted him, resulting in more consistent players edging him out for a few years. Injuries did not help his cause and Markram seemed to have lost his spark completely. Like the stereotypical superstar losing his way, he seemed to be seeing an early decline. However, with age on his side, and some tough competition in the national circuit, Markram continued to work on his game to make it to the national team. <br/>  <br/> With great composure and focus, and a crafty-yet-airtight technique which he can adjust as per the situation, Markram has a calm head on his shoulders and the confidence to go with it. Primarily an off-side player with a compact opener’s technique, Markram brings a wider repertoire of shots to a generally conservative South African top-order. <br/>  <br/> An apprentice of Mark Boucher, Markram slowly started to redeem himself at the first-class level and raised his game to a whole new level, averaging over 50 in the 2017 season. After a streak of consistent performances, a virtue that had eluded him in the past, Markram, at long last, made it to the Test fold when he was called up for the England tour in September 2017.  <br/>  <br/> He received the coveted Test cap for the Proteas in the home Tests against Bangladesh and had a dream series, scoring 255 runs in 3 innings and ended the series with an average of 255. In the historic 4-Day Boxing Day Test against Zimbabwe, he exhibited old-school grit and determination against a probing Zimbabwean attack on a seaming Day 1 track, and stroked his way to a chance-less hundred after the pitch flattened out. He started off well against India in the home series in 2017/18 with a 94 in the Newlands Test and laid the platform for victory that helped South Africa regain the freedom trophy.  <br/>  <br/> 2018 was a tumultuous year for Markram. In February, Markram found himself leading South Africa in a limited-overs series against India following an injury to regular skipper Faf du Plessis. Aged 23 years and 123 days, Markram became the second youngest to captain South Africa after Graeme Smith. In March, he struck a career-best 152 on the first day of the 4th Test against Australia in the infamous ‘Sandpapergate’ series. The tours to Sri Lanka in 2018 and India in 2019, however, saw Markram’s fortunes turn for the worse. His weakness against spin was exposed and his form deserted him.  <br/>  <br/> Nonetheless, in 2019, he made the final 15 cut for South Africa’s World Cup squad at the last minute. He and Reeza Hendricks were both fighting for the back up openers spot and it came to Markram as a combination of his runs in the domestic 50-over competition and Hendricks' failure to score big runs in the national team.  <br/>  <br/> With age on his side and a potentially long career ahead of him, Markram has burst onto the international arena with renewed focus, the intent to score big and to avoid repeating the mistakes he made in the past. Despite having the fundamental requirements as an opening batsman and possessing a good blend of defensive technique and aggressive strokeplay, Markram failed to cement himself as the first choice opener in limited overs cricket. However, deemed to be too good to be left out, Markram was crammed into the middle order, a position from where he has since had a massive impact.  <br/>  <br/> Markram’s performances and all-round impact in limited-overs cricket did not go unnoticed. In 2021, he bagged an IPL contract after he was bought by the Punjab Kings. In the following year, he was bought by the Sunrisers Hyderabad and later the same year, he was drafted into its sister-franchise, the Sunrisers Eastern Cape for the inaugural season of the SA20. That tournament was in many ways the coming of age of Markram the captain. He not only led the franchise to the title but also finished as the tournament’s third-highest run-scorer all while picking up some crucial wickets with ball in hand. Markram’s success saw him being appointed as the skipper of the Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2023 but things didn’t quite go as smoothly as they did back at home for Markram and his side finished at the bottom of the table.  <br/>  <br/> In early 2023, Markram was appointed as the full-time captain of South Africa’s T20I team.

      "bio": "Lungisani Ngidi, together with Kagiso Rabada, are the face of South Africa's potent fast-bowling attack. Standing tall at 1.93m, Ngidi is capable of bowling in excess of 140 kph, seaming it either way, and can keep the batsmen honest on the back foot with mean short-pitched deliveries. He is also known to bowl the heavy ball with an open-chested bowling run-up. <br/>  <br/> Ngidi made his Test debut against India at Centurion in January 2018, coming in for Dale Steyn, who had injured his heel in the first Test at Newlands, Cape Town. He finished with the perfect script, nabbing a six-fer on debut and impressing everyone with his pace, hostility and attitude. He famously set up a rampant Virat Kohli in his debut Test, bowling three balls outside off before angling one on the pads and trapping India's captain plumb in front, thereby helping South Africa win the Test and take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. <br/>  <br/> Ngidi made his T20 International debut against Sri Lanka at Centurion in January 2017 and was named Player of the Match for his bowling figures of 2-0-12-2. He was named a part of the One-Day International squad that faced Sri Lanka later that month too, but was later ruled out of the series due to left abdominal muscle strain. <br/>  <br/> Hung over from the success in the Test series against India, Ngidi made his ODI debut against the same opposition at Newlands but came up short, with bowling figures of 0/47 in India's convincing 124-run win. Nonetheless, Ngidi continues to be an important part of South Africa's limited-overs blueprint, although his fitness does remain a worry. Ngidi did find success in ODI cricket though, his maiden 5-wicket haul came in 2020 against Australia and he became the quickest South African bowler to reach 50 ODI wickets (26 matches).  <br/>  <br/> Ngidi and Kagiso Rabada form the crux of the South African pace attack. The fortunes of their country's journey rely on their young shoulders. Ngidi has been in and out of the side due to injuries. He also missed the 2019 Indian Premier League with a side strain. Injuries have been part and parcel of Ngidi's career and his hamstring flare-up resulted in the speedster missing a few matches in the showpiece 2019 World Cup - a tournament to forget for himself and his team. He featured in only one season for CSK in the IPL, but made an instant impact as the Men in Yellow clinched the title that year (2018). The following years at the IPL saw him miss more games than he played due to injury. He was bought by the Delhi Capitals for his base price of INR 50 lakh in the 2022 IPL Auction. <br/>  <br/> He was a part of South Africa’s squad for the 2021 T20 World Cup but didn’t feature in any game. The 2022 edition of the T20 World Cup, however, was a lot more successful for the paceman. In 5 games, Ngidi picked up 7 wickets in 4 games, including a 4-fer against India. Leading up to the tournament, he’d claimed a 5-wicket haul against England in July 2022.  <br/>  <br/> Ngidi was named in South Africa’s 15-man squad for the 2023 Cricket World Cup. ",

      "bio": "The South African bowling attack looks as peppy as ever with the triumvirate of Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi and Anrich Nortje. Tall, pacy and at the sticks always, not to forget at a pace that can be unsettling, Nortje is a pacer that can be labelled as a tearaway. Consistently clocking over 150 kph, Nortje upped his rep quickly as a fearsome fast bowler. His penchant to bowl the yorkers makes him a quintessential cricketer for the white ball formats. <br/>  <br/> Nortje had earlier travelled to India with South Africa A and also pocketed 24 wickets in the 4-day Franchise series in the 2018-2019 season to grab all the attention. Unfortunately, the tearaway quick had to miss the 2018 MSL T20 mid-way after he sustained an ankle injury. Consistent performances at the domestic level, however, led to his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in early 2019. His bad luck continued though as despite securing a lucrative IPL contract before even making his international debut, a maiden IPL appearance with the Knight Riders from Kolkata fell flat with a shoulder injury which also robbed him of a spot in South Africa’s squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Post his recovery, a Test debut against India awaited in late 2019 and his maiden five-wicket haul came in a Test against England in 2020. Nortje also made his IPL debut for the Delhi Capitals in 2020 and had a fantastic season after picking up 22 wickets from just 16 outings. Joining forces with fellow South African pacer Kagiso Rabada, the duo were instrumental in the Capitals’ run that ended in defeat to the Mumbai Indians at the final that year.    <br/>  <br/> Nortje was a part of South Africa’s squad in the back-to-back T20 World Cups of 2021 and 2022.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Kumar Abhisekh Das</b>",

      "bio": "A patient yet stern accumulator, lanky right-hand batter Hendrik Erasmus van der Dussen, better known as Rassie, is an integral part of South Africa’s international setup. Perhaps batting in a style that better suited the generation passed, van der Dussen grinded it out in the domestic circuit with a steadfast vigil. A classic Mark Ramprakash case of South African cricket - a domestic legend, but not quite making the cut for the national side. That may be a little harsh, but Rassie van der Dussen could be counted as rather unfortunate not to have played for the national team earlier - because of the abundance of all-rounders, the quota system, or otherwise. <br/>  <br/> A top-order batsman for the Lions in South Africa, van der Dussen’s formative years as a professional cricketer were spent under the shadow South Africa’s solid middle-order consisting of legends like AB de Villiers, Faf du Plessis, JP Duminy and David Miller. Even as van der Dussen churned out the runs in the domestic circuit - averaging over 40 in First Class cricket and close to 50 in List A cricket, he found himself overlooked for the national setup.  <br/>  <br/> Unfettered, van der Dussen eventually made a name for himself by plying his trade in various T20 Leagues. He was drafted into the 2018 Caribbean Premier League as an injury replacement for the St. Kitts and Nevis Patriots, having been picked on merit after scoring an unprecedented 959 runs in 10 matches in the Sunfoil series of 2017/18. He was also picked for the inaugural Global T20 league in Canada by the Vancouver Knights. He ended up as the team’s highest run-getter (255 runs) and subsequently made the cut for the Highveld Lions after exhibiting more urgency in scoring, bringing about a true revolution in his T20 game. <br/>  <br/> The elusive national call-up finally came in 2018 when he was called up for a T20I series against Zimbabwe. An ODI cap followed early next year against Pakistan and van der Dussen grabbed his opportunity with both hands. On debut, he scored a superb 93 and backed it up with an 80 in the following game. He didn’t get a bat in the third game and fell for 18 in the fourth but he reaffirmed his class with an unbeaten 50 in the fifth and final game to finish the series with an average of 120.5.  <br/> A string of consistent performances in the next couple of series saw him claim a ticket for the mega event - the 2019 Cricket World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Van der Dussen’s performance in the 2019 World Cup only affirmed his spot in the side. He headed into the World Cup as a vastly experienced professional cricketer and yet was only 9 matches old in ODI cricket. Playing with a maturity that was well beyond his slim experience in international cricket, van der Dussen ended the tournament as South Africa’s second-highest run getter, only behind skipper Faf du Plessis.  <br/> A Test cap came in the Boxing Day Test against England in 2019 and by early March 2020, van der Dussen had bagged a central contract from Cricket South Africa. <br/>  <br/> His maiden international century came a year later in an ODI against Pakistan. Steering his side out of trouble, van der Dussen finally reached the three-figure mark having fallen in the nineties twice previously and aged 32 years and 54 days, he became the oldest South African cricketer to score maiden hundred.  <br/>  <br/> A mainstay in South Africa’s setup by now, van der Dussen was named in South Africa’s squad for the 2021 T20 World Cup. He left a mark in South Africa’s last game of the tournament by scoring a blistering 94 not-out against England. A broken finger ruled him out of the 2022 T20 World Cup but he was named in South Africa’s 15-man squad for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Anurag Hegde</b>",

      "bio": "A destructive middle-order batter and an exceptional fielder who’s also capable of keeping wickets, Heinrich Klaasen is almost the perfect modern-day white-ball package. Whilst pursuing his bachelors' degree at the University of Pretoria, Heinrich Klaasen gained an interest in cricket after he made it to his college team. Rising through the ranks, he was handed a first-class debut for the Northerns in the 2012/13 season. Having taken the longer route to the top through domestic cricket rather than age-level cricket, Klaasen piled on the numbers and had an exponentially rising graph in his first three seasons, starting off with an average of 42 in his debut season which inflated to an exemplary 65 in his third. <br/>  <br/> The sheer weight of runs and his consistency gave him a license to play first-class cricket, and he immediately made an impression, falling just short of a double-hundred in February 2017 to help the Titans beat the Dolphins in the penultimate round of the first-class competition. Consistent performances throughout the season earned him a ticket to New Zealand as a reserve wicketkeeper. Unfortunately, however, he did not make the playing XI and missed out on the coveted Test cap. <br/>  <br/> South Africa's National Academy coach Shukri Conrad hailed him (a little controversially) as the 'poor man's Dhoni'. “Heinrich stays very calm in the situation. He stays in the moment. There’s very much a ‘poor man’s MS Dhoni’ about him. There are really no sideshows to his game and he doesn’t wait for the game to come to him. That is what I like most about him. He is as tough as they come.” <br/>  <br/> As it so happened, Klaasen got the opportunity to play against MS Dhoni when India visited in early 2018, replacing an injured de Kock in the ODI series. In an otherwise dismal limited-overs leg for the hosts, Klaasen was the shining light, earning himself the man of the match award in the only two games that the Proteas won. Pitted against the top-ranked international side in the world, Heinrich has turned out two composed performances under pressure. His T20I debut too came in the following T20I series against India and he was mighty impressive once again, winning a player of the match award for his 30-ball 69. He found himself back in the Test squad later that year for a series against Australia but didn’t feature in any game again. His Test debut eventually came in 2019 against India.  <br/>  <br/> Quickly making a name for himself as a middle-order powerhouse and an exceptional fielder when he wasn’t behind the stumps, Klaasen was in demand amongst T20 franchises around the globe. His IPL foray came in unusual circumstances as he joined the Rajasthan Royals as a late call-up in 2018.  Having impressed during the white-ball series against India, the wicket-keeper batsman was called up as a replacement for Australia's Steve Smith - who found himself with a one-year ban on account of the 'sandpaper fiasco'. Although he wasn't a first choice player, Klaasen acquitted himself fairly well in the four games he got to play. Released before the 2019 auctions, Klaasen was bought by the Royal Challengers, who snapped him up at the base price of 50 lakh rupees.  <br/>  <br/> It took a while for Klaasen to find success in the IPL and he spent the majority of his time at RCB running the drinks. In the meantime, however, Klaasen was building up a solid reputation as a limited-overs cricketer whenever he got an opportunity. His maiden ODI hundred came in 2020 against Australia and he was always in the reckoning for the national side. He was part of both the 2021 and 2022 T20 World Cup squads but only played 4 games combined.  <br/>  <br/> The year 2023, however, was Klaasen’s real coming of age. He started the year off with a blistering century for Durban’s Super Giants in the SA20 and he backed that up with another century in the IPL, this time for SRH against his former side RCB. Later in the year, playing the MLC, Klaasen struck yet another hundred playing for the Seattle Orcas and became the first player to score a century in the MLC. He had a successful campaign in The Hundred as well scoring 189 runs in 7 games for the Oval Invincibles.  <br/>  <br/> His top-form meant that he was called up for the 2023 Cricket World Cup as a reserve wicket-keeper.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Rishi Roy</b> and <b>Anurag Hegde</b>",

      "bio": "A left-arm wrist-spin bowler who has climbed the ladder South Africa to become their first choice spinner in the limited overs formats, Shamsi started at a time when spin was being taken more seriously in South Africa’s domestic circles. It's not just his variations which are impressive, but also the accuracy along with those variations, and he becomes threatening when batsmen go after him. A cheerful character, Shamsi is just as well known for his celebrations as he is for his bowling with the 'bus driver' and 'shoe call' celebrations being his most popular.  <br/>  <br/> His big break came in franchise cricket, when Royal Challengers Bangalore drafted him in as replacement for the injured Samuel Badree in IPL 2016. Shamsi only featured in four matches all season and couldn't give a fair account of himself, partly due to some pretty harsh conditions for bowlers. <br/>  <br/> By 2017, he had made his debut in all three formats for South Africa. However, the presence of an established performer like Tahir in the team, who was also a wrist-spinner,meant that the opportunities for Shamsi were few and far between. <br/>  <br/> Shamsi first started playing in the domestic circuit in 2009 for Gauteng, before moving to Kwa-Zulu Natal where he struggled for success, and shifted base again to join the Titans. <br/>  <br/> The first few years didn't bring the impact which Shamsi must have desired. It was in 2013/14, when he finished as the third-highest wicket-taker with 47 wickets to his name, in the three-day Cup that he got noticed and claimed a more concrete position for the Titans. <br/> In 2015, Shamsi earned a contract with St Kitts and Nevis Patriots - the Caribbean Premier League franchise, where he ended up as the leading wicket-taker, helping him secure a deal with an IPL franchise. In a rather rare art, especially in South Africa, Shamsi played for Paarl Rocks in the Mzansi Super League. In the inaugural edition of MSL, the wrist-spinner was the most economical bowler (6.30 RPO) in the competition. <br/>  <br/> Shamsi was named in the 2019 World Cup squad - his first appearance in the mega event. Thanks to Tahir's presence, he found it difficult to make it to the playing XI. Shamsi was picked for two round-robin encounters in the multi-nation tourney, but the tweaker not only remained wicketless but was also expensive. The retirement of Imran Tahir post the World Cup, however, meant that Shamsi was now seen as South Africa’s main spin weapon. His career started to pick-up a different trajectory as he started to get more exposure and experience.  <br/>  <br/> In early 2021, Shamsi climbed up the charts and became the number one rated bowler in ICC’s T20I Rankings. He was picked in South Africa’s squads for both the 2021 and 2022 T20 World Cups and picked up 8 wickets from 5 games and 4 wickets from two games respectively. In July 2022, Shamsi picked up figures of 5/24 in a T20I against England and surpassed Dale Steyn’s 64 wickets to become South Africa’s leading wicket-taker in T20I cricket.  <br/> He was named in South Africa’s 15-member squad for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.

      "bio": "Keshav Maharaj is a committed and wholehearted performer. A calculating left arm orthodox spinner who can bowl at any stage of the innings and a handy right-handed lower order batsman, Maharaj made his first-class debut at the age of 16 for KwaZulu-Natal in 2006-07. He was promoted to the Dolphins team in 2009-10. <br/>  <br/> He toured Bangladesh with the South Africa Academy in April-May 2010, taking 13 wickets in the two four-day matches against Bangladesh Cricket Board Academy. He also took 4 for 12 off four overs, opening the bowling, in one of the T20 matches. He played for South Africa A against the touring Bangladesh A team in 2010-11. <br/>  <br/> He played for Cuckfield in the Sussex Premier League in 2013. He signed to play as a professional for Nelson in the Lancashire League in 2015. He was included in the KwaZulu-Natal cricket team squad for the 2015 Africa T20 Cup.  <br/>  <br/> A consistent performer, Maharaj strode into the national team on the back of a fine domestic season and was taken as the first-choice spinner on the tour of Australia in late 2016. A classical left-arm spinner, Maharaj has since then emerged as the ideal foil for South Africa's stellar pace attack. On helpful surfaces, he can be South Africa’s trump card, as reflected during the tour of New Zealand, where he emerged as South Africa's leading bowler with 15 wickets. He followed it up with 17 wickets from four Tests against England. An ODI debut followed in 2017 during South Africa’s tour to England and he was also included in the squad for 2017 Champions Trophy.  <br/>  <br/> Maharaj played County Cricket in 2018 and 2019 representing Lancashire and Yorkshire respectively and enjoyed decent returns. The trajectory of his international career soared upwards as well and he’d become South Africa’s first choice spinner in red-ball cricket while also always being in the reckoning for the limited-overs formats. Maharaj registered his best figures in Test cricket, a startling 9-129, in the second Test of South Africa’s tour to Sri Lanka and became only the second left-arm spinner, after Rangana Herath, to claim 9 wickets in a Test innings.  <br/>  <br/> Perhaps Maharaj’s greatest achievement came in 2021 when he became only the second South African to take a Test hat-trick. In the second Test of South Africa’s tour to the West Indies, Maharaj removed Keiron Powell, Jason Holder and Joshua da Silva off successive deliveries to script his place in history.  <br/>  <br/> In a bizarre turn of events, Maharaj was named captain of South Africa for a T20 series in Sri Lanka despite not being capped in the format yet. Maharaj captained his team to victory on debut and even picked up a wicket off his very first delivery in T20I cricket. He went to be a part of South Africa’s squads for both the 2021 and 2022 T20 World Cups and was named in South Africa’s 15-man squad for the Cricket World Cup in 2023.  <br/> ",

      "bio": "Towering over his teammates at 6.8ft tall, Marco Jansen has an unmistakable presence on the field - at least when he’s not playing with his twin-brother Duan. Marco had started to create waves in South Africa’s domestic circles while still a teenager and by the time he’d turned 22, he was already a South African Test player. Hailing from the North West province, Marco’s talent was first spotted by his father Koos when the former scored an unbeaten 164 in a T20 game aged 9. Training both brothers, Koos saw his efforts rewarded when the boys were called up as net bowlers for India at the Wanderers during their 2018 tour. Impressing Virat Kohli as a 17-year old is not a feat many can lay claim to and it was one of many giant strides that Marco would go on to take in the years that followed.  <br/>  <br/> Consistently hitting 140ks while hurling bolts from his lanky frame, not to mention his handy and powerful batting ability saw Marco rise through the domestic ranks pretty quickly. His List-A debut came in the 2017-18 season and was followed by his First Class debut shortly thereafter. His ability to extract prodigious swing with the new ball and his propensity to hit the deck hard and extract unsettling bounce made him a tough customer to deal with. Add to that the variations he developed, including a searing yorker and a deceptive slower ball, Jansen was almost the complete all-format bowler. The only hurdle that stood in his way was consistency.  <br/>  <br/> Perhaps the greatest validation for Jansen’s skills came when he was scouted and picked up by the Mumbai Indians for IPL 2021. He became one of just a handful few overseas players that had made their IPL debut before their international one. While he only got a couple of opportunities in that season, Jansen had made enough of a name for himself to be picked up by the Sunrisers Hyderabad.  <br/>  <br/> An international call-up was not far away, Jansen was added to South Africa’s squad for their tour of Pakistan in January 2021 but he’d have to wait till the end of that year to make his debut. It came in the Boxing Day Test against India in 2021 and his ODI and T20I debuts came soon after in the following year. He found himself in South Africa’s squad for the 2022 T20 World Cup as a replacement to the injured Dwaine Pretorious and in 2023, ahead of the Cricket World Cup, Jansen was named in South Africa’s 15 member squad.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Anurag Hegde</b>",

      "bio": "Vernon Philander isn't in the quick bracket, but when conditions are in his favour, he is the probably the most dangerous bowler to face. With the gift of accuracy and the ability to nibble the ball off its seam, he's become South Africa's most reliable weapon with the red cherry. However, not only is he a brilliant medium-pacer, but is also handy with the bat in the lower order.  <br/>  <br/> Philander represented South Africa in the 2003 Under-19 World Cup played in Bangladesh. He also played for the Cape Cobras for whom he had an impressive 2006-07 season in which he averaged 72 with the bat and 30 with the ball. This fantastic performance immediately earned him a spot in the national squad. He made a remarkable ODI debut against Ireland in 2007, picking up four wickets, playing an important part in South Africa's victory. This in turn gave him a direct access to playing in the World T20 in 2007.  <br/>  <br/> Philander made his Test debut against Australia in November 2011 and was awarded the Man of the match for picking up a brilliant 5 for 15 in the second innings. He was also the Man of the Series, picking up a total of 14 scalps across two Tests, including two five-wicket hauls. In his third Test, he again registered two successive five-fers against Sri Lanka, becoming the fifth player in Test history to take five wickets in an innings in each of his first three Tests. He earned a national contract in 2012 and continued to deliver sensational performances. In only his seventh Test, Philander crossed the mark of 50 wickets and became the second fastest bowler to achieve the feat. <br/>  <br/> Over the next year, Philander churned out several impressive performances. In December 2013, he took his 100th Test wicket against India in only his 19th match, becoming the joint-sixth fastest ever bowler to do so. <br/>  <br/> Philander couldn't sustain that momentum while venturing less greener pastures, which was understandable, but still proved to be effective even in conditions which didn't suit his style of bowling. <br/>  <br/> Injuries also played their part in slowing him down. After the Test in Mohali, Philander missed three Tests on the tour of India in 2015 due to torn ankle ligaments. From there on, his fitness only deteriorated. <br/>  <br/> Still, while not as frequently as before, Philander continued picking wickets. He even played a major role in South Africa's famous 2-1 Test win in Australia in 2016, memorably destroying the hosts on the first morning of the second Test in Hobart. <br/>  <br/> While he is undeniably one of the top Test bowlers, the same can't be said about the limited-overs formats, where Philander hasn't been able to achieve the same level of success. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Cricbuzz Staff</b> <br/> ",

      "bio": "Arguably New Zealand's finest batsman since the legendary Martin Crowe, Kane Williamson had been a wonder kid since his teenage days. His exceptional talent included the rare Non-Asian skill to play quality spin apart from being adept against fast bowling. It would be fair to say the Williamson family boasted of sports freak all around. While his father had played cricket at certain age groups, his mother was a fine basketball player and his sisters excelled in volleyball. It was therefore not a surprise when Kane took a liking to sports and it happened to be cricket. <br/>  <br/> Since his Under-19 days, it was expected that Williamson would one day become the backbone of New Zealand's batting apart from being their captain. His leaderships skills were in abundance, just like his batting. Along expected lines, the year 2010 saw Williamson donning the Kiwi colors, making his international debut in Sri Lanka for the tri-series that also featured India. His white-ball cricket started in tragedy with ducks in his first two innings but his class couldn't be hidden for long as he stroked a ton against Bangladesh in Dhaka later that year. The Test call up came and it was for a challenging trip to India but Williamson made a massive statement but racking up a century on debut. <br/>  <br/> The following years saw Williamson scoring runs albeit not at the highly consistent levels that one expected from him. That changed in 2014 though during ODI home series against India when he also broke a heap of records. With fifty plus scores in all five games, he became only the second batsman in ODI history (after Yasir Hameed) to achieve this feat. He also became the fourth New Zealand player to hit five or more consecutive fifty plus scores in ODIs. His five fifty plus scores are also the most by a NZ batsman in a bilateral series. <br/>  <br/> If 2014 was a superb year for Williamson, it was 2015 that put him officially into the big league of batsmen. He notched up 1172 runs in Tests at a staggering average of 90 apart from amassing a gargantuan 1376 runs in ODIs at a strong average of 57. More than the numbers, it was the effortless ease with which he handled bowling attacks that impressed everybody. 2015 was also a historic year for New Zealand as they made their first ever World Cup final appearance. <br/>  <br/> Being a regular player and having leadership skills at his disposal, it was only a matter of time before Williamson was appointed New Zealand's captain across formats. It happened in early 2016 after Brendon McCullum announced retirement from all forms of international cricket, just before the World T20 in India. It was a huge role but Williamson took to it fairly well, much like people had expected him to. Still a long way to go as captain in terms of success but the one thing that stands out about his leadership skills is his ability to be tactically street-smart. <br/>  <br/> Williamson's batting is a purists delight - what with his classy strokeplay blending nicely with his footwork and gritty temperament. The only slight flaw that can be mentioned about his batting could be his relative inability to score quickly at will. You could argue that his role is that of a sheet anchor around which the other Kiwi batsmen revel. However, if he can raise his white-ball skills a notch upward, he could be a real phenomenon in world cricket. This is not to suggest that he hasn't produced impact knocks in the shorter formats. There have been quite a few knocks in that regard and he had shown in the 2017 IPL that he can adapt to that role easily. <br/>  <br/> Kane Williamson, who is often referred to as a classical Test batsman, was first signed by an IPL franchise in 2015. The Sunrisers Hyderabad had him in their kitty for less than $100,000, and in the first season, he didn't return the dividends - particularly given the limited opportunities he had in an unfamiliar lower-middle order position. Williamson was a part of the side when the franchise coasted to their maiden title under the captaincy of David Warner in 2016, and was retained once again for the 2017 season (for $460,500), as the franchise showed trust in him and his ability to be the rock in the batting order around which the innings could be built. After the 2018 auction, however, David Warner was banned from the 2018 season of the IPL and was stripped from the captaincy, and the franchise handed Williamson the reins for the 2018 season. Against all odds, the Kiwi skipper exhibited a different dimension in his batting, hammering 735 runs at 52.50 and a strike-rate of 142.44. Moreover, he also led his side into the final, only to be defeated a second time by the Chennai Super Kings in the play-offs. <br/>  <br/> One of his most memorable World Cup knocks came against Australia in the Pool A match of WC 2015. New Zealand were set a target of 152 by the Aussies and Mitchell Starc was breathing fire on that particular day. The left-arm pacer had claimed six wickets in the match and Australia were almost on the verge of defending a paltry total, but Kane Williamson came to rescue and hit a cracking six to take the Kiwis over the line. As a result of KW's knock of 45*, New Zealand pulled off a thriller by 1 wicket. <br/>  <br/> In March, 2018 Williamson claimed the record for the most centuries by a New Zealand batter in Test cricket, after he scored a ton against England in Auckland. He followed that up with away centuries against Pakistan and Bangladesh, as he amassed over 6000 runs in Test cricket.  <br/>  <br/> Later that year, Williamson captained New Zealand at the 2019 World Cup, and played clutch knocks against South Africa and West Indies. He also scored a crucial fifty in the semi-final against India, as New Zealand upset one of the favourites to reach the final. New Zealand lost that final by the ‘barest of margins’ and the Kiwi skipper accepted his fate with a smiling face. He was also named as the Player of the Tournament for the 2019 World Cup for scoring 578 runs across 10 matches. <br/>  <br/> A year later post the Covid resumption, he got his highest score in Test cricket against West Indies, when he got 251 in a game at Seddon Park. Some months later, Williamson took charge of the New Zealand team for the very first Test Championship final, and got an unbeaten fifty in the second innings as the Kiwis claimed their first ever piece of silverware in cricket. Williamson was captain a few months later for the 2021 T20 World Cup, where New Zealand reached the final where they were upstaged by Mitch Marsh and Australia.  <br/>  <br/> Williamson stepped down as captain a year later in Tests, with Tim Southee taking charge. He got a century on a placid wicket in Pakistan in December, 2022. He got some big scores in the home summer as well, but the last couple of years have been riddled with injury - particularly a recurring shoulder injury and a ligament tear which he suffered in the opener of IPL 2023. Williamson was captain of the New Zealand team in the 2024 T20I World Cup, where they suffered an embarrassing group stage exit. He stepped down from captaincy shortly after.  <br/>  <br/> He is undoubtedly one of the greatest batters of this generation, but is often criticized for having a stark difference in his home and away average. Williamson’s injury woes have also led him to slide a bit lower in the last couple of years in the discussion of the ‘best ever’, although he still boasts a Test average in excess of 50. ",

      "bio": "'Brash' - that is the word Brendon McCullum, easily the greatest of all the Kiwi glovesmen, and one of their finest batsmen, uses to define himself.   <br/>  <br/> Adam Gilchrist and MS Dhoni might be the first names that come to mind when we discuss pyrotechnics-prone wicketkeepers, but this Kiwi hunk would definitely be a prime contender. Younger son of a First-Class player of Otago, this explosive stumper from Dunedin, New Zealand, was first selected for his country, not surprisingly, more on the back of his batting rather than his wicket-keeping skills. Predominantly favouring the leg-side, especially the cow corner, McCullum has made a name for himself by piling on quick runs as an opener in the 50 and 20-over format of the game. <br/>  <br/> In the longer version of the game, his first few centuries came against lesser opponents like Zimbabwe and Bangladesh and, except for a 96 against England at Lord's, he didn't have any strong performances against the heavyweights to justify his place in the side. But all that changed in the fifth year of his career, when he racked up his third Test hundred against India in quick time at Napier in 2009. McCullum, followed it up by amassing a double ton laced with a blend of composure and savagery against India in Hyderabad. In 2010, McCullum, decided to relinquish the keeping mitts to focus on his batting. <br/>  <br/> With the fame of his batting pyrotechnics reaching far and wide, McCullum was one of the first to be snapped up at the auction of the inaugural IPL by KKR for a princely sum of $700,000. The defining moment of his career in the shortest format of the game, undoubtedly has to be his unbeaten 158 against RCB, in the first match of the inaugural IPL in 2008. The innings included as many as 13 sixes. He became the first man to score 1000 runs in T20 Internationals, and the first player to score two T20I centuries. One of his best performances in the format came in 2010 against Australia in Christchurch, when McCullum ramped and toppled on his way to an unbeaten 116, scooping Shaun Tait thunderbolts consistently for sixes, and recklessly led his team to what proved to be a match-winning total of 214. <br/>  <br/> In December 2012, McCullum became the captain of New Zealand, under rather controversial circumstances, from Ross Taylor. Under McCullum's captaincy, New Zealand were crushed 3-0 in the Test series by South Africa. However, they recovered to win the ODI series against the hosts and drew the Test series 0-0 against England at home. In fact, under his commendable leadership, the Kiwis haven't lost a Test series since their away tour to England in 2013. <br/>  <br/> In 2014, McCullum touched dizzying heights as a batsman. He became the first cricketer from New Zealand to reach the coveted landmark of a triple century against India in Wellington; and several New Zealand fans must have been relieved of the heartache caused by Martin Crowe's 299, all those years ago. He continued to bludgeon ridiculously brisk double-tons as he bludgeoned one off just 186 balls against Pakistan in Sharjah. However, he shrugged off the achievement and dedicated it to the memory of Phillip Hughes, who copped the fatal blow to his neck during the Test match in November 2014. In the Test series against Sri Lanka, he came close to breaking the record for quickest double ton in the history of Test cricket before he was dismissed for 195 off just 134 balls. He was also named the 'New Zealand cricketer of the year' in 2014. With 179 dismissals to his name, McCullum has also effected the second-highest number of dismissals by a New Zealand wicket-keeper.  <br/>  <br/> In New Zealand's 3rd match of the 2015 Cricket World Cup, McCullum scored 77 runs of 25 balls recording the fastest fifty in world cup history (51 runs off 18 balls), and the 3rd fastest fifty in ODI history. He also scored a brutal 59 against South Africa in the semi-final. McCullum became the first Kiwi captain to lead New Zealand in the World Cup final, and his touching letter to school-teachers requesting them to give students the day off to watch the World Cup final was trending on social media at the time. However, he was bowled for a duck by Mitchell Starc and New Zealand were never able to recover from the blow. <br/>  <br/> McCullum continues to play T20 leagues around the world, and leads the Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash League, and he has played 11 matches in two seasons for the Heat, scoring 370 runs at a destructive strike-rate of 158.80. McCullum, the holder of several T20I records, would be looking to lead from the front with the bat and take his strong team to the title in upcoming 7th edition of the Big Bash. <br/>  <br/> One of the fittest cricketers of the modern age, McCullum became the first player to make 100 consecutive Test appearances from his debut. He announced his retirement in the Christchurch Test against Australia in February 2016 at the age of 35. He recorded the fastest hundred in Test cricket in his final Test, hacking away at a potent Australian attack for 145 runs off just 79 balls, presenting his team and his fans with a signature farewell innings filled with audacity and daring. <br/>  <br/> From running Muttiah Muralitharan out as a 'brash' youngster to prevent a Sangakarra century, to apologizing to Sangakarra for it whilst delivering the Cowdrey Lecture in 2016, Brendon McCullum has come a long way in his career. He has matured as a cricketer to become an inspiration to his entire nation, and by extension, the entire cricketing fraternity. Baz has grown to be one of the most balanced cricketers of his age, playing with the expected level of aggression, and upholding the spirit of the game at the same time. <br/>  <br/> <b>Interesting Facts: </b>  <br/> <i>Picked up by NSW for the final of KFC Big bash in 2009, he donated the fees from the game to Otago Junior cricket.</i> <br/>  <br/> <i>McCullum is married to Ellissa McCullum (née Arthur), an Australian from Caniaba, New South Wales. They have a son Riley and a daughter Maya. </i> <br/>  <br/> <i>His brother, Nathan, has also played for New Zealand as an off-spinning all-rounder</i> <br/>  <br/> By <b>Rishi Roy</b> <br/> <i>As of December 2017</i>",

      "bio": "Ross Taylor has to be one of the unsung heroes of this decade in international cricket. The bloke has over 6000 runs in both Tests and ODIs, at an average of 48 and 45 respectively. Impressive numbers, right? Yet when we talk of the finest batsmen in world cricket, seldom would you see Taylor's name coming up in a debate. It's an irony for his persona though, considering the way he stormed into international cricket with a freewheeling style of strokeplay that thrilled the crowd to bits.  <br/>  <br/> Having made his debut on the domestic circuit during the 2002-03 season, he slowly emerged as a reliable batsman for Central Districts across formats. The 2005-06 season is what propelled his career upwards with a national call up coming in early 2006 for home ODIs against Sri Lanka. He made an immediate impression, whacking his maiden century in the series to set the tone for his career. A few more notable contributions came later in the year which ensured that he would soon be given the Test cap. However, it came during a tough tour of South Africa in 2007 and it was baptism by fire for the young Taylor.  <br/>  <br/> However, he found his feet during the home summer against England, churning out his maiden Test ton during the series apart from three fifties. The return series in England further established Taylor's credentials in the longest format. Scoring runs there is always an acid test for any batsman and he came up with a masterclass knock of 154 at Manchester after an impresive 74 at Lord's. Despite having an unorthodox technique, Taylor's quick hands and steely determination meant that he could adapt to situations and any attack.  <br/>  <br/> It was from the 2011-12 season onwards that he managed to be exceptionally consistent across formats, notably in Tests. Since then, he has been a vital cog of the Kiwi batting line up, almost always being the crisis man for the side against tough oppositions. In 2016, there seemed to be a slight dip in his gameplay but an eye operation followed and Taylor returned with a bang. Despite being a fairly good batsman in T20 leagues across the globe, he hasn't quite struck the same chord while playing for New Zealand in the shortest format. It did seem like he might out of the reckoning in T20Is after the 2016 World T20 but the home series against Pakistan in January 2018 saw him making a comeback, albeit as a replacement, and doing a fine job. <br/>  <br/> A destructive player when on song, Taylor is a pure matchwinner who can dismantle any attack, be it pace or spin. He does have his share of technical deficiencies but the hand-eye coordination the unorthodox strokes do make up for in a long way. The 2019 World Cup may well be his swansong and he would definitely a key member if the Kiwis are to stand a chance in winning the title. <br/>  <br/> <b>World Cup - Through the Years</b> <br/>  <br/> Having featured in World Cup 2007, 2011 and 2015 - Ross Taylor is the most experienced player in New Zealand's squad of World Cup 2019. In 2007, in his first ever World Cup appearance, Taylor was dismissed for a duck against England and he had pretty low scores throughout the tournament that season. His first ever World Cup century came against Pakistan in 2011 and that remains to be his only World Cup century till date. Ross had an impressive World Cup 2011 where he performed consistently but again in 2015 he failed in the initial few games. <br/>  <br/> Towards the later stages of World Cup 2015 is when Taylor got back amongst the runs. With scores of 56, 42, 30 and 40 against Bangladesh, West Indies, South Africa and Australia respectively, Taylor chipped in with handy contributions but it was his inability to convert these starts into big scores that was a concern. With him being the most experienced batsman in the squad for WC 2019, it's high time Taylor starts performing consistently and helps New Zealand get into the knock-outs. The 2019 World Cup may well be his swansong, hence the middle order batsman would be looking forward to make it a memorable one. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan</b> ",

      "bio": "Trent Boult, the left-handed swing bowler made his First-Class debut when he was picked for the New Zealand 'A' team for the tour of India in 2007. Later on, he was selected for the Under-19 World Cup in 2008. Boult was in and around the New Zealand team, but only made his Test debut in Hobart in December 2011. <br/>  <br/> Boult's first Test wicket was Michael Hussey as he picked up four wickets in the match and helped New Zealand win a Test in Australia for the first time since 1985. He had a fairly good start to his career as he has picked up wickets against England, West Indies, India and Sri Lanka. His moment of glory came in the second Test against West Indies at Basin Reserve, where he got his first 10-wicket haul. That performance also gave Boult his first Man of the Match award. He continued to have a great time in Test cricket as he picked up 10 wickets in the two games against India, which New Zealand won 1-0. On the basis of his fine performances in Tests, Boult was selected for the T20 World Cup in Bangladesh. The left-armer grabbed the opportunity of playing in T20Is with both hands and picked up four wickets in two matches. <br/>  <br/> He was a regular member of the Test side and was always amongst the wickets. He bagged seven wickets in the first Test against Sri Lanka in Christchurch and helped New Zealand win the Test match. He made a comeback into the ODI side for the home series against South Africa in October 2014, but did not feature in the games against Pakistan in UAE. Due to his ability to swing the ball, both ways at pace, the selectors named him in the squad for the 2015 World Cup. <br/>  <br/> Boult finished joint-highest wicket-taker in the 2015 World Cup with 22 scalps, enhancing his reputation as one of world cricket's exciting new talents with the ball. His high point came in the group stage victory over Australia, where he demolished the eventual champions with 5 for 28. Few of his other impressive spells came against West Indies at Wellington and Afghanistan at Napier where Boult claimed four wickets and three wickets respectively. The match where Guptill scored a double ton was one of them and the other one was against Afghanistan where the Blackcaps steamrolled the opposition by six wickets. New Zealand's horses for courses approach in the World T20, which earned them a lot of accolades, meant that Boult didn't feature in the entire 2016 edition. But that had nothing to do with ability, something which was affirmed by his approx $600K IPL contract when Sunrisers Hyderabad signed him up in 2015. <br/>  <br/> Unlike most bowlers, Boult has the ability to switch between the three formats effortlessly with minimum fuss. Such has been his rise across formats that there is a talk going around that Boult is slowly but steadily set to displace Southee as the spearhead of the Kiwi pace attack. 2017 was a wonderful year for Boult in white-ball cricket as he picked up multiple 6-fers including a 7-fer. <br/>  <br/> For his performances, Boult was awarded the Sir Richard Hadlee medal for the best International cricketer of the year at the NZC awards. Boult continued to perform consistently and formed a fearsome duo with Southee across formats. It was no surprise that he was named in New Zealand’s squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. Boult was impressive again, and his campaign included a hat-trick against Trans-Tasman rivals Australia. In the final that saw England win under dramatic circumstances, Boult was entrusted to bowl for New Zealand in the super over. Boult was also named in New Zealand’s squad for the 2021 T20 World Cup and it ended another heart-breaking loss to Australia in the finals. Boult, however, ended the tournament as New Zealand’s highest wicket-taker with 13 scalps to his name. He continued to be a part of New Zealand’s squad for the 2022 T20 World Cup - a campaign that ended for the Kiwis after their loss to Pakistan in the semi-finals. <br/>  <br/> 2022 was a tumultuous time for Boult as he requested to be released from his central contract with NZC to enable him to spend more time with his family and take part in domestic leagues across the globe. Criticized by some for putting his own needs above that of his country, Boult went ahead with the decision that relieved him of the obligation to turn up for New Zealand as and when required. Despite falling down the pecking order, Boult continues to be an important player for the Blackcaps. <br/>  <br/> Boult made himself available for the 2023 ODI World Cup in India. He had a mediocre return to International cricket, as he managed just 10 wickets in 10 games as New Zealand lost to India in the semi-finals. Boult was back for the Kiwis in the 2024 T20I World Cup, which proved to be a nightmare tournament for them.  <br/>  <br/> New Zealand lost to Afghanistan and West Indies, getting knocked out in the group stages. Post that disappointing World Cup performance, Boult announced his retirement from International cricket.  <br/>  <br/> Over the last few years, Boult has been a rather silent assassin as his numbers have been phenomenal to say the least but you wouldn't see him in the limelight at all. That's probably a Kiwi trait in cricket - to be unassuming and more behind the scenes than the others. The ability to swing the new ball and cleverly mix the pace/lengths at the death overs makes Boult a deadly white-ball customer while his skills in the longest format are no less. Truly an asset for New Zealand cricket and all the other franchises he represents across the globe. <br/>  <br/> IPL Through the years <br/>  <br/> After starting off with the Sunrisers in 2015, Trent Boult’s IPL journey saw him travel across the country. After two seasons with SRH, Boult was bought by the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2017 but he played just 5 games. After a good 2018 season with Delhi, with Boult scalping 18 wickets from 12 games, he was retained for the 2019 season but played only 5 games. His standout year came in 2020 after being traded to the Mumbai Indians. Boult was instrumental in Mumbai’s 5th title triumph, picking up 25 wickets, including a spell of 3-30 in the final that earned him the Man of the Match award. Bowling in tandem with Jasprit Bumrah, Boult was exceptional and he was also awarded the Player of the Series award. He had an uneventful, yet decent season in 2021 before being bought by the Rajasthan Royals for a massive INR 8 crore in the 2022 Mega Auction. <br/>  <br/> In the three seasons that Boult spent at Rajasthan Royals, he performed admirably as he claimed 45 wickets for the franchise. Boult was solid with the new ball and often bowled three on the trot in the powerplay. He helped RR get to the final in 2022, where they were defeated by Gujarat Titans.  <br/>  <br/> Boult was released by Rajasthan ahead of the mega auctions, and he was reunited with some old pals as Mumbai Indians bid for him at the 2025 IPL auctions.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "The outswinger is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Tim Southee. That has been the delivery which has caused most damage from him, although over the years, he has developed a vast repertoire of deliveries. Apart from a fine new-ball bowler, he has developed into a fine old-ball bowler too with the pace variations and reverse swing being his ally. Apart from being a very wily bowler, Southee has also shown on quite a few occasions that he can hit the long ball. Safe to say he has been one of the gems to have come out of New Zealand in this millennium. <br/>  <br/> It was the 2008 Under-19 World Cup that shot Southee to fame. He ended as the Man of the Tournament and made everyone who watched him bowl to sit up and take notice. He was fasttracked into the New Zealand Test side and made his debut in the home series against England. A 5-fer and a sparkling 77 in the second innings is what he had to show, an emphatic statement that told the world that he had arrived on the big stage. In the return series in England, he also made his debut in the shorter formats and has been a regular member of the Kiwi line-up ever since. <br/>  <br/> Most of New Zealand's key achievements after 2000 have seen a Southee stamp on it somehwere. Semifinal finish in the 2011 World Cup had him playing a major role as he scalpd 18 wickets at an excellent average of 17.33 - ample proof of his ability to adapt to sub-continental conditions. A rare Test win in Sri Lanka followed during the 2012-13 season and Southee was at the helm there as well with an excellent eight-wicket match haul. He was also on song during the 2015 World Cup where New Zealand made their first ever appearance in a final. <br/>  <br/> Southee's key skill is his ability to read a surface quickly, thereby readjusting his pace, lengths and line with aplomb. The crafty nature of varying the pace is a skill he mastered over the years which helped him shine a lot in white-ball cricket. Since the arrival of the prodigious talent that is Trent Boult, he has formed a staggering new-ball partnership that can be counted among the best in the world. The duo feed off each other and have wrecked havoc in the opposition batting line-ups more often than not. Brendon McCullum's ultra-aggressive mode of captaincy that changed the cricketing fortunes of the Kiwis depended on a lot on the Southee-Boult partnership. <br/>  <br/> Southee has played his part in quite a few T20 leagues across the globe, notably the IPL where he represented some big teams like Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians. Injuries have plagued his career over the last few years which has had an impact on his white-ball career. The dip in pace hasn't helped either and also the fact that there are younger pacers waiting in the wings to take on the mantle. However, the reputation that he carries ensures that he still remains a vital name on the team sheet. <br/>  <br/> The white-ball future could be a tad uncertain for Southee although it seems like he wants to carry on till the 2019 World Cup. He enjoyed a decent Champions Trophy 2017 in England although the Kiwis failed to make it to the knockout stages of the tournament. Though his white-ball fortunes have faded a bit in the recent past, Southee still has it in him to make an impact particularly with the new ball and in the slog overs of the innings. He is also the spearhead of the attack who mentors the other quicks around him with his experience that is invaluable. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Most of New Zealand's key achievements after 2000 have seen a Southee stamp on it somewhere. Semifinal finish in the 2011 World Cup had him playing a major role as he scalped 18 wickets at an excellent average of 17.33 - ample proof of his ability to adapt to sub-continental conditions. He was also on song during the 2015 World Cup where New Zealand made their first ever appearance in a final. His career best spell of 7/33 came in World Cup 2015 where Southee destroyed England's batting line-up with his lethal spell with the new ball. He was unplayable and it was due to his bowling spell that England were wrapped up for a paltry score of 123 at Wellington. <br/>  <br/> The New Zealand pacer had a start-stop beginning to his IPL career. He was picked for the 2011 season by Chennai Super Kings and though he won them their first game by defending 6 off the final over, Southee played only a couple more after that as Doug Bollinger replaced him. The championship winning team did not retain him and he was left in the wilderness for two years. <br/>  <br/> Rajasthan Royals bought him back to the league in 2014 for INR 1.2 crore. He didn't play much because of Royals' strong foreign recruits. The same happened in 2015 and once Rajasthan were terminated, Southee moved to Mumbai Indians for the next two years. <br/>  <br/> In the first season with Mumbai, Southee played 11 games and returned with 9 scalps for an average of 36. The second year he was overlooked for the likes Mitchell McClenaghan and Mitchell Johnson. In 2018, Royal Challengers Bangalore entered the fray for the Kiwi and picked him for his base price of 1 crore. He went on to become the main death bowler for RCB and that in return made them retain him. Following that, Southee was a part of Kolkata Knight Riders for a few seasons.",

      "bio": "An enigmatic strokemaker by design, Martin Guptill has been one of the mainstays of New Zealand's batting in white-ball cricket over the years. Guptill's early life was struck with tragedy when at the age of 14, he suffered a forklift accident which resulted in him losing three toes on his foot. However, he put that setback aside and he featured in the New Zealand team for the Under-19 World Cup that was held in Sri Lanka.  <br/>  <br/> Guptill played for the Auckland Aces in the 2007-08 season and he started off by scoring 99 in his debut match. He topped the batting charts and then did the same during the Emerging Players Tournament in Australia later that year. An ODI call up happened soon and he grabbed it with both hands, smashing a fine century on debut - the first Kiwi batsman to achieve this feat. The heroics in the series helped him get a Test cap for the tour of India. <br/>  <br/> A key feature of Guptill's batting is the rhythm  of his strokeplay. When in flow, he is a very difficult batsman to stop because of his impeccable ability to deal the pacers as well as spinners. There could be days when he can get out in frustrating ways but that's the nature of the beast that Guptill is. Won't be wrong to say that all this is worth the kind of matchwinner he has been for the Kiwis.  <br/>  <br/> In the 2011 World Cup, Guptill was the second highest run-getter for New Zealand and in the 2015 edition, he again performed fairly well including an unbeaten 237 in the quarterfinal which made him the first Kiwi batsman to notch up an ODI double ton. There have been several impact knocks by Guptill over the years, most of which have single-handedly destroyed the opponents. The consecutive ODI tons in England during the 2013 tour which helped New Zealand win the series, comes to mind. He even held the highest individual score by a Kiwi then (189) before breaking it himself in the 2015 World Cup. <br/>  <br/> Although he's been a mainstay in the shorter formats with streaks of genius here and there, that's not been emulated in the Test arena where he was being persisted with, for a period of time. The 2016 tour of India was the tipping point after which the selectors decided to omit Guptill from the Test squad. It wasn't as if he was failing but his continuing issues of not converting starts into significant knocks meant that he had to make way. With the success of Raval and Latham at the top, it's tough to see Guptill making a comeback in red-ball cricket. <br/>  <br/> Guptill might have exited the Test squad but in the shorter formats, his impact is obvious to one and all. The fantastic century in Australia in late 2016 and the dazzling 180* against South Africa in early 2017 were some of the strokemaker's recent emphatic statements in white-ball cricket. He continues to be a significant player at the top of the order for New Zealand and with Colin Munro joining him as the co-opener, the Kiwis now have ample firepower to kickstart an innings. As far as T20 leagues go, the ability to hit them clean has resulted in stints with IPL's Mumbai Indians, CPL's Guyana Amazon Warriors as well as St Kitts and Nevis Patriots, and BBL's Sydney Thunder. He's also played in the English county for Derbyshire and more recently Lancashire.  <br/>  <br/> <b>World Cup  - Through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> In World Cup 2011, Guptill was the second highest run-getter for New Zealand and in the 2015 edition, he again performed fairly well including an unbeaten 237 in the quarterfinal which made him the first Kiwi batsman to notch up an ODI double ton. There have been several impact knocks by Guptill over the years, most of which have single-handedly destroyed the opponents. Martin even held the highest individual score by a Kiwi then (189) before breaking it himself in the 2015 World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Martin Guptill's average in ODIs is 43.51 while his average in World Cup matches is 57-odd.\tThe only drawback is that the opener has scored these runs against sides that have a rather weak bowling line-up. He has struggled against sides like Australia, South Africa and England. That remained a lone dark spot in what was otherwise a superb all-round career, the inability to get big runs off challenging opponents. Guptill called time on his career in 2025. In all, Guptill represented New Zealand in 367 internationals, spread across all the three formats of the game. ",

      "bio": "Daniel Vettori looks more like a nerdy geek with his school-boyish spectacles than a cricketer. However the saying 'don't judge a book by its cover' never held truer than in Vettori's case, who is comfortably one of New Zealand's greatest ever cricketers. <br/>  <br/> He became the youngest Kiwi to play a Test match when he made his debut at the age of 18 against England in 1997. His ODI debut came a month later, against Sri Lanka, at Christchurch on 25 March 1997. <br/>  <br/> Vettori has a classical action and a couple of telling variations and he is regarded as the best exponent of left-arm spin in the game since Bishen Singh Bedi. He has a beautiful loop, and deceives the batsmen in flight, often changing the pace and the trajectory of the ball to leave the batsmen fooled. He also has a killer arm ball which curves back in wickedly at pace, to catch the batsmen off-guard. In recent times, he has added some variations like the one that moves away from the right hander ever so late. <br/>  <br/> Vettori has often borne the brunt of being the sole wicket-taker for New Zealand in Tests and luckily for them he has the ability to bowl long spells and possesses patience in abundance. He is willing to plug away at batsmen, working on their weaknesses before snaring them with an unexpected delivery. His current Test average of 33.61 might seem a tad high for someone to be considered world class, but it should be remembered that he has operated without support for the most part in a team that has always been weak. When New Zealand did have another strike bowler in their ranks in Shane Bond, it has shown Vettori's value more truly. In matches that Bond has played in, Vettori's average has been a world beating 24.74. <br/>  <br/> Vettori was thrust with the mantle of the New Zealand captaincy after Stephen Fleming stepped down post the 2007 World Cup. Soon enough, it was announced that Vettori would captain the Black Caps in all forms of the game. <br/>  <br/> He had a far from smooth initiation into the job, with a number of high profile players such as Stephen Fleming, Chris Cairns, Nathan Astle and Craig McMillan retiring, and two of the leading bowlers - Shane Bond and Daryl Tuffey - joining the rebel ICL, but he stuck to the task manfully, leading a bunch of inexperienced and rookie professionals through some difficult series.  <br/>  <br/> Vettori, who started off as a bowler who could bat a bit, has worked superbly on his batting skills, having scored 3,000 Test runs including five centuries as well as several half-centuries. Although it took Vettori 47 Tests to score his first 1,000 runs at an average of 17.24, the second thousand took him just 22 Tests at a rate of 42.52. He has been the rock in the Black Caps side in the lower middle-order and has had to promote himself up the order often, to rescue a talented but fragile top order.  <br/>  <br/> Vettori gave up captaincy of the National side after the 2011 World Cup. The Kiwis reached the semi-final but lost to Sri Lanka, which caused him to hand over the leadership to Ross Taylor. He also suffered a series of injuries which have kept him out of the team for a while. These days he doesn't play much with the emergence of Nathan McCullum and Ish Sodhi. He is yet to announce his retirement and by the looks of things it won't be long as he last played for New Zealand in June, 2013.  <br/>  <br/> Vettori is one of the few nice guys left in cricket and he rarely loses his temper. He was picked by the Delhi Daredevils for US$625,000 in the inaugural IPL auction. His penetrative spin bowling has added a cutting edge to their attack, leading Sehwag to dub him the best spinner in the world in 2009. However, he was let go after his contract expired and Royal Challengers Bangalore snapped him up in the 2011 auctions. Vettori was also made the captain and in that very year he took the Bangalore franchise to the final but they eventually lost to Chennai. He continued captaining the side in 2012 and 2013, but injuries and form made him to step aside and let Virat Kohli take over. In a surprise move, Vettori was made the head coach of the Bangalore team just before the 2014 auctions. <br/>  <br/> Vettori played the Big Bash League for Brisbane Heat in January 2014 and was made stand-in captain in place of the injured James Hopes. He played the home ODI series against South Africa in October 2014, before making a shock return to Test cricket - after a gap of two years - in the third Test against Pakistan at Sharjah in November 2014. However, he stressed that he did not want to prolong his Test career and did not feature in the home series against Sri Lanka. He continued to play the 50-over format. With a lot of experience behind him, Vettori is one of the key players for New Zealand at the 2015 World Cup. <br/>  <br/> <b>Little known facts about Vettori:</b> <br/>  <br/> Vettori was born to an Italian father and a Kiwi mother making him the first cricketer of Italian descent to represent New Zealand. <br/>  <br/> He is only the eighth player in Test history to take 300 wickets and score 3,000 runs. He also holds the record in Tests for making the most runs at No.8. <br/>  <br/> He has the distinction of having dismissed Shane Warne the most times in Test matches - getting him out nine times, most notably for 99 in a Test at Perth thus denying Warne his only Test hundred.  <br/>  <br/> Vettori is one of the most powerful men in New Zealand Cricket today - he is the leading bowler, one of the main batsmen, a safe fielder, captain, and one of the selectors of the New Zealand team. To top it all, he was even the standby coach for a short while after Andy Moles was sacked. <br/>  <br/> by <b>Srivathsa</b>",

      "bio": "Santner got his chance to represent New Zealand once Daniel Vettori decided to retire from the game. He is a like-for-like replacement of the veteran. Having played only 19 List A matches for Northern Districts, the selectors saw the potential in him and fast-tracked him to the national side. Santner was sent on the England tour to play a couple of practice games as some of the Kiwi players were absent due to their IPL commitments.  <br/>  <br/> In only his first game on English soil, Santner impressed everyone, not with the ball, but with the bat. The youngster scored 27 and 94 in the two innings. He was part of the Test squad, but didn't get an opportunity. However, he made his way in the side during the ODI series. He played all 5 matches - picked up 7 wickets and scored 97 runs. Though New Zealand lost the series 3-2, Santner was one of the positives to have come out. He, along with Ish Sodhi, makes New Zealand a decent spin attack these days.  <br/>  <br/> Since his debut, Santner has been an impressive prospect although the 2016-17 season has been a bit tough for the young man. Despite all the obvious talent, Santner has struggled to come to terms with what his stronger suit is. While some feel that he is a clever bowler who can bat a bit, it isn't wrong to call him a proper batsman considering this technique and temperament. <br/>  <br/> Santner's batting particularly dipped during the 2016-17 phase while his bowling hasn't been that effective either. Santner did start 2018 brightly though and the IPL selection by CSK boosted him further, only for an injury to rule him out for a major part of the year. Considered by many as the next Daniel Vettori, the legend himself has rated Santner highly and hopes that the all-rounder can end up as one of the country's finest cricketers.  <br/>  <br/> Santner was a key player for New Zealand in the 2019 World Cup where they reached the final, as he kept things economical as the only frontline spinner of the side. In November 2020, Santner captained New Zealand for the first time in a bi-lateral series against West Indies. He was clinical for New Zealand in the 2021 T20 World Cup as well, where they reached the final once again. In the 2023 ODI World Cup, Santner became the first Kiwi spinner to register a five wicket haul at an ICC event. That was another world event where New Zealand reached the semis, and Santner proved to be a steady eddy for them once again.  <br/>  <br/> In 2024, Santner was roped into the Test team for their away tour to India. He was sensational in that series, picking 13 wickets in the second Test match as New Zealand completed an unexpected 3-0 whitewash of India in India.  <br/>  <br/> In December 2024, Santner was announced as the new ODI and T20I captain of New Zealand, with Kane Williamson stepping down. Under his captaincy, New Zealand won the Tri-Nations trophy against Pakistan and South Africa, and also reached the final of the 2025 Champions Trophy.  <br/>  <br/> In the world of franchise cricket, after years of being an underused player at CSK, Santner this year will be plying his trade for a new franchise as he was picked by Mumbai Indians for IPL 2025.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "Tom is the son of former New Zealand player Rod Latham. He is a wicket-keeper batsman, who made his First-Class debut for Canterbury, after being part of the New Zealand squad for the U-19 World Cup in 2010. Tom didn't make much of an impact in First-Class cricket, but a hundred in the Ford Trophy gained him a call up for the series against Zimbabwe. <br/>  <br/> In a rain-curtailed match against Sri Lanka, where New Zealand had to chase down 203 in 23 overs, Latham combined well with Luke Ronchi to see his side through to a fine victory. He scored a well-measured 86 which got him the Man of the Match award. He was soon handed his first Test cap against India in 2014 when Ross Taylor was unavailable. Latham was dismissed for a duck in the first innings, but got a start in the second and scored 29. He travelled with the team to the West Indies and scored three successive fifties in the first two Test matches. <br/>  <br/> On the back of some good performances, he made a comeback into the ODI side for the home series against South Africa, but did not have a great time with the bat. The subsequent ODI series against Pakistan wasn't fruitful for him either. He, however, accrued back-to-back hundreds in the first two matches of the Test series against Pakistan. <br/>  <br/> Over the years, Latham has established himself as an old-school Test opener who grinds out the new ball and sets the stage for the strokemakers later on. As far as the limited overs formats go, after Brendon McCullum's retirement, he seemed to have cemented his place as an opener in the team. He did show a fair amount of consistency but there was a belief that Latham wasn't able to force the pace at will - an imperative skill these days for a limited-overs opener. <br/>  <br/> Despite being less-aggressive in nature, Latham did produce the goods and had a good time in 2016-17 when he considerably improved his game in the 50-over format. However, he was later slotted to the middle order, mainly for the tour of India due to his ability to play spin. That coincided with the promotion of Munro as an opener and the latter's instant success at the top meant that Latham continued to cement his place in the middle-order, helping his team build crucial partnerships while at it. Much like Latham's batting, his glovework is also quite dependable and he has adapted to the role with ease despite not being a specialist by design. This ability of his means that New Zealand have more balance in their side. <br/>  <br/> Latham, time and again, proved that he has great skill and composure to handle spin. While he's good at playing the sweep, Latham also loves using his feet to smother the threat from the spinners. His improved consistency with the bat, primarily in ODIs and Tests, helped him earn the vice-captaincy role and also continues to remain as one of the key members of the New Zealand batting line-up. <br/>  <br/> In December, 2018 Tom Latham carried the bat in a Test against Sri Lanka, as he got his highest ever score of 264. He was picked for the 2019 ODI World Cup as well next year, and played all games as a middle order batter as New Zealand reached the finals.  <br/>  <br/> A year later, Latham captained New Zealand for the first time in a Test match with regular skipper Kane Williamson missing out due to illness. He also captained the side against India in a few ODIs later where Williamson was out injured. His ODI career though suffered a blip post 2022 with Devon Conway taking over as opener, alongside the likes of Rachin Ravindra and Will Young.  <br/>  <br/> Latham’s Test career though remained solid, as he scored his second double century during the home summer of 2022. He ended that year with a ton against Pakistan on a placid pitch in Karachi. Latham took over as Test captain in October, 2024 after former skipper Tim Southee stepped down following a 3-0 humbling by Sri Lanka.  <br/>  <br/> His first assignment as full time skipper was an away series against India, and he managed to produce astonishing results. Latham led from the front and got starts in almost all games, countering the spinners with his sweep shots as New Zealand managed a 3-0 whitewash.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "An attacking left-handed batsman who relishes batting at the top in limited-overs cricket, Conway is also an efficient wicket-keeper. Born and brought up in South Africa, Conway made a shift to New Zealand in 2017. With close to 100 First-class games and 70 List A games to his credit, Conway was already an established name in South Africa's domestic circuit and it didn't take long for the Southpaw to impress the New Zealand selectors. One of his biggest strengths is his adaptability across formats. <br/>  <br/> On arriving in New Zealand, Conway joined the University Club and gradually started plying his trade in the Super Smash for the Wellington Firebirds. He was mostly a standby in the initial days with the odd game in between but first-choice keeper Tom Blundell's national call up allowed Conway more game time, thereby pushing his case further. Thereafter, he represented Wellington in all three formats of New Zealand's domestic season and enjoyed reasonable success while at it. <br/>  <br/> Conway made his debut for New Zealand after being eligible to play for the country from August 2020. His first international debut came in the shortest format (T20Is) and soon he became a regular across formats for the Kiwi nation. On his Test debut at Lord's, Conway made a superb 200 as he announced his arrival on the grandest stage in style. Currently Conway is an indispensable part of the New Zealand side and is one of their best batters. <br/>  <br/> Conway's exploits for New Zealand drew worldwide attention when he was picked by CSK in the 2022 mega auction for INR 1 Crore. Having played a considerable amount of league cricket across the globe, Conway continues to remain a key member of the national side. Consistency and composure are Conway's best allies, and his average in all three formats stands as a thumping testimony to all the hard work he put in during the initial stages of his playing career. <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "Son of former New Zealand rugby coach John Mitchell, Daryll is an all-rounder who bowls medium pace. Having made his First-class debut in the 2011-12 season, it didn't take long for the Northern Districts man to make an impression across formats. His adaptability has been the key factor in his success. Growing up in a sports background helped Daryl to hone in the discipline from the formative years and he credits his dad for the same. <br/>  <br/> Predominantly a middle order batsman, Mitchell's game revolves around a solid base that expands with the repertoire of strokes as his innings builds. His bowling may not be his biggest strength, but he's had the knack of picking up wickets with a mix of slower ball variations. The 2018-19 season seemed to be a breakthrough phase for him as consistent performances in the domestic circuit, especially in the Super Smash earned him his maiden national call up during the home T20Is against India in February 2019. <br/>  <br/> He also played a vital part in helping New Zealand reach the finals of the T20 World Cup 2021. Mitchell was promoted to open the batting along with Guptill during that tournament and the all-rounder didn't disappoint. He compiled 208 runs from 7 games, striking at 140.54 with a healthy average of 34.67.  <br/>  <br/> Mitchell loves pace and bounce on the ball and his experience of playing in Perth during his early days helped him a great deal in facing bouncers at will. Having played plenty of T20 leagues across the world coupled with consistency, Mitchell cemented the batting all-rounder spot and continues to be a regular feature for New Zealand since 2021. <br/>  <br/> One of Mitchell’s finest hours as a red ball cricketer came in 2022 on New Zealand’s tour of England. He scored 538 runs at an average of 107.6, but New Zealand were blown away by England’s Bazball revolution as the hosts triumphed 3-0. A year later, Mitchell was one of the star performers for New Zealand in the 2023 World Cup. He scored a superb century in the semi-final, nearly taking the game away from India.  <br/>  <br/> Apart from his contributions for New Zealand, Mitchell has also been a regular in franchise tournaments. He has played for the London Spirit in the Hundred, and was also picked by Chennai Super Kings for the 2024 IPL. ",

      "bio": "A genuine fast bowler who can hit tremendously high speeds from a tall frame, Lockie Ferguson has everything in him to become a match-winner for New Zealand. In today's era, we often see many fast bowlers having to reduce their speeds to be more durable in the international arena. Like most of them, Ferguson is also rather injury-prone but what has impressed is his undying determination to bowl fast. It was his ability to generate raw pace that handed him a First-class debut in 2012-13 and a couple of seasons later, he shone brightly with his attributes reaping success in a big way. Ferguson shot to fame during the 2014-15 first class season where he bagged 21 wickets. He followed the performance with 31 wickets in the following season, propelling the selectors to take a note of him. However, it was much later in December 2016 that he got a chance to don the New Zealand jersey when he replaced an injured Adam Milne in the ODI side for the series against Australia.. <br/>  <br/> A T20I debut also followed in early 2017 although he hasn't played since his maiden game. Ferguson has featured in a few 50-over games for New Zealand and although his numbers are a bit patchy, there is no doubt regarding the impact he can provide on his day. New Zealand think tank does value his enigmatic skills and are planning to handle him with care so that he can become a long term weapon of the limited-overs team. <br/>  <br/> Sometimes Ferguson struggles with his lines but with the amount of speed he generates, that's bound to happen. Players who struggle against the short ball need to be wary of Ferguson. He mostly bowls attacking lines, hence the fast bowler's economy rate is on the higher side. On good batting wickets, if Ferguson doesn't hit the right lines and lengths, he might concede plenty. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Lockie Ferguson's growth as an express fast bowler co-incided with a lucrative contract with the now defunct Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS), who secured him with a base price contact of Rupees fifty lakhs in 2017. Despite having played only a handful of matches, his raw pace and clever variations saw him impress the IPL scouts. Coming to the 2019 auctions, Kolkata Knight Riders warded off a spirited challenge from Kings XI Punjab to land their target at a cost of 1.6 crore rupees. <br/>  <br/> Lockie Ferguson was a part of Kolkata Knight Riders from 2019-2021, and he was picked by the Gujarat Titans for IPL 2022. The speedster had a decent season for the Titans as he picked 12 wickets in the tournament. Ahead of IPL 2023, Ferguson was traded from Gujarat Titans by his former team - Kolkata Knight Riders.",

      "bio": "A leg spinner with a lot of flair, Ish Sodhi's career has been a mixed path so far but the good part is that he has finally started to realize the potential which was seen in him quite early in his career. He had barely finished a First-class season before making his Test debut at the young age of 19. It's always tough for a Non-Asian spinner (especially a Kiwi) because the majority of the pitches at home barely have anything in it for the spin bowlers. There are a handful that are slightly slower in nature but then again, don't turn much at all. Despite all the odds, Sodhi fought hard. That was a work in progress that was there for all to see. Even in the sub-continent, he couldn't create the impact a spinner usually does due to his inability to hit the right lengths. Experience, clearly was lacking in a big way but the talent on offer was a temptation. <br/>  <br/> Till late 2014, Sodhi was persisted with in red-ball cricket before the Kiwi selectors decided to axe him. The domestic performances had shown that he was a much better bowler in the shorter formats, perhaps one made just for those. In the latter half of 2015, he made his ODI debut. Since then, he has been a part of the limited-overs squad. The 2016 World T20 was a defining moment for him as he, along with Mitchell Santner, impressed one and all throughout the tournament. The duo's sterling performance against India on a raging turner was the most talked about thing then. It also provided a new lease of life for Sodhi who decided to focus more on white-ball cricket. <br/>  <br/> Sodhi, as the name suggests, comes from a family with Indian roots. They had shifted to New Zealand where the young Ish pursued his cricketing fortunes from a tender age. A wrist spinner is always a tempting proposition, particularly in today's modern era where most pitches are batting friendly. Add to it the two new balls in 50-over cricket which has made life hard for the finger spinners. Sodhi, however, didn't let the off-field expectations get to him and focussed mainly on developing consistency in hitting the right lengths. Thanks to the backing of selectors and his experience of playing several T20 leagues - Sodhi continues to remain a key player of the Kiwi set-up. <br/>  <br/> <b>by Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "An explosive all-rounder, who is more suited to the abbreviated forms of the game, Colin de Grandhomme stepped up to the international circuit after setting a string of impressive domestic displays in motion. He hit 3 hundreds for Auckland in the Plunket Shield last year with his medium pace option coming as an additional boost. He also played a pivotal all-round role in Auckland winning the HRV T20 Cup in 2010-11.  <br/>  <br/> He was called up to the Blackcaps team for the home series against Zimbabwe and South Africa in 2012. Born in Zimbabwe, Grandhomme represented Zimbabwe in the Under-19 World Cup in 2004 before migrating to New Zealand in search of better opportunities. A national call up soon followed in 2012-13 for the shorter formats. His ball-striking skills and utility medium pace made him a good pick in limited-overs cricket. <br/>  <br/> However, ironically, it was in his Test debut that de Grandhomme managed to make a bigger statement. He ran riot in the home series against Pakistan in the summer of 2016 on seaming pitches where his medium pace was enough as long as accuracy was there. His 6-fer on debut were the best figures by a New Zealand debutant. Although not a regular in the Test side since then, de Grandhomme is often considered on pitches that have movement in them. The reason for this is his ability to move the ball, even if at a moderate pace - a skill that grows in strength considerably on greenish tracks. Apart from this, his counter-attacking batting skills are also an added advantage. <br/>  <br/> It's still early days in de Grandhomme's career but his ability to turn a match on its head makes him a very handy cricketer to have, particularly in white-ball cricket. If New Zealand decide to revamp their batting order in Tests, he could be a regular feature in the longest format as well. It can safely said that de Grandhomme is yet to translate his potential completely on the international stage although we have seen glimpses of his talent. New Zealand's love affair with all-rounders is well known and the Kiwis will hope that de Grandhomme is able to cement his spot across formats in the years to come. <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> The 2016-17 season was a breakthrough year for de Grandhomme. Not only did he make his Test debut but was also called up by Kolkata Knight Riders as a replacement for Andre Russell. Though he played for most parts of the season, de Grandhomme got very limited opportunities with bat and ball. His standout performance was 3 for 4 on a seamer friendly wicket at Eden Gardens against Bangalore.  <br/>  <br/> The 2018 season marked 10 years of IPL and all teams looked to build for the future and de Grandhomme was not in KKR's plan. He was picked up by Bangalore for INR 2.2 crore from a base price of 75 lakh. The shift didn't change his fortunes as he didn't start the season and when he did, the chances were very little. However, with a strike rate of 166 in T20s, RCB did not want to let go of the burly all rounder. <br/>  <br/> <b>World Cup 2019 - What to expect</b> <br/>  <br/> Having featured in New Zealand's playing XI regularly in recent times, Colin de Grandhomme is the first choice seam all-rounder for the Kiwis. de Grandhomme might start ahead of James Neesham in WC 19 and his ability to build pressure from one end with economical spells is one of the reasons that gives him an edge. Also, he can hit the long ball, hence you can expect him to chip in with his handy all-round contributions throughout the course of the tournament. If he maintains his discipline and gets wickets, the all-rounder might prove to be a pivotal member of the playing XI.   <br/>  <br/> By <b> Hariprasad Sadanandan </b>",

      "bio": "An attacking right-handed wicket-keeper batsman, Glenn Phillips, is widely tipped as one of the next generation batsmen from the Antipodes nation. Having made his List A debut in 2015, Phillips shone for his Auckland franchise during that season's domestic Twenty20 competition, making a 32-ball 55 on debut against Otago. He ended the tournament as the leading run-scorer for Auckland, piling up 369 runs while at it. That ensured a call-up to the national U-19 team, for the 2016 World Cup. <br/>  <br/> Phillips' climb to the top of the ladder was swift and made his first-class debut during the 2016-17 season. His ability to score quickly was noticed and the batsman made his Twenty20 debut for New Zealand, against South Africa, in 2017. Known for his high-backlight and sprightly fielding, Phillips got plenty of opportunities in various T20 leagues across the globe. His record in the CPL in his debut season (2017) is nothing short of exceptional as he racked up 457 runs at 41.54 with a strike rate of 146.94. <br/>  <br/> Besides exhibiting great skill and consistency in the T20 leagues, Phillips also made the most of his opportunities for the New Zealand A side. His 64-ball 104 against Sri Lanka, at the SCG, during the 2022 T20 World Cup spoke volumes about the talent the pocket rocket has. A few months later (May 2023), Phillips smoked a 7-ball 25 (that included 3 sixes and one four) against Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur, to turn the tables and help his team (SRH) record an unbelievable win.  <br/>  <br/> Phillips played all of New Zealand’s games in the 2023 ODI World Cup as well, scoring 285 runs to help his side reach the semi-final where they were eliminated by India. Post that, Phillips was in demand for the Test team as well, playing nearly all the Tests for New Zealand since being re-selected for the tour to Bangladesh in late 2023.  <br/>  <br/> He has been used as a number seven batter, who doubles up as a handy off spinner while playing in the sub continent. Phillips has carved a nice niche for himself as a middle order batter in this New Zealand Test team, often forging valuable runs with the tailenders in home and away games. He has also been deployed as a specialist gully or backward point fielder, taking plenty of screamers for the Kiwis in that position. Phillips was an integral part of the away whitewash of India in October, 2024 - picking 8 wickets and scoring 114 runs.  <br/>  <br/> A gun fielder in the outfield, Phillips continues to remain an X-factor player for the Kiwis who could kill the game in a matter of minutes with his incredible ball-striking ability. <br/>  <br/> <b>By Pradeep Krishnamurthy</b>",

      "bio": "Bradley-John Watling, after being born in South Africa, moved to new Zealand with his family when he was 10 years old. A top order batsman with a good technique, Watling has also been used as a wicket keeper on numerous occasions. <br/>  <br/> He was part of the New Zealand under- 19 team that played in 2003-04 and soon impressed the people at Northern Districts to draft him into the squad. In 2006-07, he repaid their faith with a superb showing with the bat becoming the teams second highest run scorer that season. He went a notch higher next season, averaging above 60 in the ODI format for the Northern Districts.  <br/>  <br/> His stunning and consistent showing earned him a place in the national squad. He was chosen for the series against Pakistan in 2009 but was not included in the final XI for the ODI series. His wicket keeping skills got him a spot in the T20I game following the ODIs.  <br/>  <br/> He also got a chance to prove his Test credentials, when he was chosen ahead of Peter Fulton for the 3rd Test against Pakistan. He did justice to his selection getting to a quickfire 60 in the second essay. Watling finally made his ODI debut in 2010, when he was picked for the Tri series that included Sri Lanka and India. <br/>  <br/> On his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in August 2010, Watling top-scored for New Zealand with 55 runs. He was in and out of the New Zealand squad after that many a times losing his place to the likes of Kruger van Wyk and Luke Ronchi. In 2012, Watling performed brilliantly in the West Indies and Sri Lanka ODI series. He registered his personal best score of 96* against Sri Lanka in the 3rd ODI at Pallekele. <br/>  <br/> 2013 was again disappointing and  he was dropped once again after a few ODIs. In Tests, however, Watling has done slightly well as compared to the other formats of the game. He scored his maiden ton against Zimbabwe in 2012 helping the Black Caps posting an intimidating total that allowed them to win the one off Test by an innings and 301 runs. He continued this form in 2013 putting up consistent performances in the Tests against South Africa and England. Watling scored 173 runs in the 2 Tests against Bangladesh in October 2013, which included his second Test ton and retained his place in the Test squad. <br/>  <br/> Watling scored his third Test ton (124) against India in the second Test and along with Brendon McCullum put up a fighting 352-run record 6th-wicket stand to save New Zealand from a likely defeat. In retrospect, that one performance has been the turning point in his career. Since that knock, his Test average has seen a marked rise over the next two years. There was a hundred against England at Leeds which contributed to a famous win in 2015. Even though his limited overs career has not been moving smooth, he is primed to be a regular face for New Zealand behind the stumps in the longer format for days to come.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Cricbuzz staff</b> ",

      "bio": "New Zealand has no dearth of quality all-rounders and Colin Munro is one of those talented blokes. Born in Durban, Munro represents Auckland at domestic level and was also a part of the U19 team of the 2006 World Cup in Sri Lanka.  <br/>  <br/> Munro's entry in the domestic circuit was not very eye-catching but his consistent and fiery performances in the T20s came with time. He played a crucial role in Auckland's HRV Cup triumph and was later a part of the Auckland Aces team in the 2012 Champions League T20 in India.  <br/> He finally got noticed by the selectors and made his T20I debut against South Africa in December 2012. An ODI debut in the same series followed. He scored his maiden ODI fifty in the 2nd match of the series. A Test cap followed soon after, but he was out on a golden duck in the first innings.  <br/> Munro hit his second fifty in ODIs in New Zealand's humiliating series against Bangladesh in the final ODI and hit a quick-fire 73 off just 39 balls in the T20I that followed, giving New Zealand their only victory in the series.  <br/>  <br/> Since then, Munro was a regular feature of the New Zealand T20 side but has been in an out of the 50-over format owing to his inconsistencies. His naturally aggressive instinct and ability to take the game away from the opposition in a jiffy made him a tempting option for the selectors in the limited over cricket. The 2016-17 season was a breakthrough phase of sorts of Munro as consistent domestic performances saw him gets back into the ODI squad and he has performed fairly well since then. <br/>  <br/> The year 2017 has been the best phase of Munro's career as he started to translate his potential into match-winning contributions. His form in the shortest format went up a notch as he became the fourth player (second New Zealander) to produce multiple T20I centuries after Chris Gayle, Brendon McCullum and Evin Lewis. The fact that he cracked both the tons in a space of barely six months speaks volumes of his confidence and touch. His 50-over fortunes have also picked up since the Kiwis decided to offer him the opening spot. Munro has been able to make an instant impact with his aggressive opening partner Martin Guptill. <br/>  <br/> Munro's game went up another notch in the 2017-18 summer at home as he tore into the visiting West Indian bowling. He shone both in the ODIs and T20Is, scoring his third century in the shortest format thereby putting himself in a league of his own. While the southpaw has always had the power game without doubt, the small change that can be seen is his willingness to be more consistent. With the kind of dynamics in his batting, if he can be consistent, the opposition is likely to be sent on a leather hunt more often than not. <br/>  <br/> Colin Munro has made quite a name for himself in the T20 format. He has performed excellently across the globe in various T20 leagues. However, in IPL Munro wasn't able to stamp his authority. His first assignment in the league was in 2016 with the Kolkata Knight Riders but bleak returns saw him play just 4 games. He returned to the tournament after being signed by the Delhi Capitals in 2018 but after a couple of unsuccessful seasons, he was let go in 2020. He saw a dip in form and also found himself dropped from New Zealand's international setup with players like Devon Conway, Finn Allen and Will Young making strong cases for selection.  <br/>  <br/> A true modern-day cricket mercenary, Munro has played in a lot of leagues around the globe. The IPL, CPL, PSL, BBL, ILT20 and The Hundred are amongst a growing list of leagues that Munro has been a part of.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan and Varun Dixit</b>",

      "bio": "Born to Indian parents in Wellington, Rachin Ravindra is an attacking left-hand batter who can also bowl some quality left-arm spin. Thanks to his all-round skills, he was identified as a special talent in the domestic circuit and got ample opportunities with the U-19 and New Zealand A side, before making bigger and better strides. With a healthy strike rate of around 100 in the shorter formats, Rachin usually plays at the top of the order for Wellington and is known for his attacking channels with the ball. <br/>  <br/> His consistency in the domestic circuit helped him earn an international debut for New Zealand (against Bangladesh in a T20I in September 2021), and it didn't take long for the Southpaw to make his Test debut as well (against India in November 2021). Interestingly, Rachin's father,  Ravi Krishnamurthy, is a huge fan of the legendary Indian duo Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid and thus, named his son Rachin (By taking 'Ra' from Rahul Dravid and 'chin' from Sachin Tendulkar).  <br/>  <br/> 2023 was the coming of age year for Rachin Ravindra. He was initially not even in contention for the World Cup, but an injury to Micheal Bracewell paved the way for him. Ravindra looked at ease playing in the sub continent, using his feet nicely to tackle spin bowling. He was a revelation at the World Cup, starting off with a century against England in the tournament opener. Ravindra scored 578 runs in the World Cup and won the ICC Emerging Cricketer of the Year award.  <br/>  <br/> Ravindra’s World Cup performances made him a mainstay for New Zealand across formats, as he was picked primarily as a top order batter who can occasionally bowl some spin. He scored a century at home against South Africa in 2024, and later in that year scored a sensational century against India in Bangalore which helped the Kiwis win the Test and later the series.  <br/>  <br/> Ravindra was on song in the 2025 Champions Trophy as well. After suffering a seemingly ghastly head injury in the build-up to the tournament, Ravindra missed the opening game. He was back in the side for the next game against Bangladesh, batting at number 4 in place of Daryl Mitchell. Ravindra marked his Champions Trophy debut with a match winning ton against Bangladesh, and followed that up with a century against South Africa as well in the semis. He was the player of the tournament in the 2025 Champions Trophy, where New Zealand reached the finals.  <br/>  <br/> Ravindra was initially picked by Punjab Kings at the IPL Auctions, but CSK used their RTM option to get him back to Anbuden for IPL 2025.  <br/>  <br/> With age on side, one would expect Rachin to make huge strides in international cricket given his multifaceted skills across formats.",

      "bio": "An explosive top order batter in the limited over formats, Finn Allen made his T20I debut against Bangladesh at Hamilton in March 2021. It wasn't a great debut though as Allen was dismissed for a duck in his very first internation match. However, he played a better knock later in the same series. In the third T20I of his debut series, Allen played a breathtaking knock at Auckland where he smashed 71 off 29 deliveries. An innings where he scored at an outstanding strike rate of 244.82 that consisted of 10 boundaries and three maximums.  <br/>  <br/> Allen notched up his maiden century in the shortest format against Scotland at Edinburgh and proved his mettle. As a result of that innings, NZ posted a huge first innings total of 225 and they won that particular contest by 68 runs. Following that knock he had a string of low scores in T20Is, but Allen played some useful knocks in ODIs where he chipped in with handy contributions for a brief period. The aggressive opener has the potential to play aggressive knocks and give quick starts, but he lacks consistency. He'll probably get better with experience, and on his day he has the ability to take down most of the bowling attacks. ",

      "bio": "When Babar Azam notched up his 5th ODI ton against West Indies in his 25th innings in early 2017, he became the second quickest after Quinton De Kock to score five ODI tons. His aggregate of 1306 runs after 25 knocks tallied the highest, beating Jonathan Trott's numbers. Life indeed has been on fast tracks for Babar Azam. His three consecutive ODI tons against the Windies in 2016 in the UAE were a precursor to one glorious career that stares at us. <br/>  <br/> Pakistan's search for a dependable number 3 in the shorter formats has been an eternal one. Their batting stocks at the international level, especially in the shorter formats have looked as bare as Old Mother Hubbard's cupboard. The arrival of Babar onto the big scene however can't exactly be termed as serendipity. <br/>  <br/> Ever since he was drafted into the Pakistan under-19 team for the 2010 World Cup as a fifteen year old, it seemed as if another raw talent has been unleashed. However, some polishing resulted in another under-19 World Cup campaign in 2012. This time he was the skipper. Pakistan were knocked out by eventual winners India but Babar had piled the runs to be the top run getter for his team. <br/>  <br/> The journey post that was through the domestic system and come his chance in 2016, Babar grabbed it with hands as big as tentacles against the Windies in the UAE. A Test debut against the caribbean team also went well and the fairytale had a continuity. But flaws were ripped open on the bouncy tracks of Australia in late 2016 and early 2017 in the whites. But given the fact that he wants to emaluate Virat Kohli' feats and idolizes ABD, Babar would carve a way out. <br/>  <br/> Babar Azam is the cousin of Akmal (Kamran, Umar and Adnan) brothers and is often denoted as a talented batsman. He was the leading run-scorer in the tri-series that included Sri Lanka and Bangladesh Under - 19 in 2009. His consistency at Under - 19 level pushed the selectors to offer him a chance to play for his national side. <br/>  <br/> Over the years, Babar Azam has shown tremendous consistency across all formats and is considered as one of the best players in the history of Pakistan cricket. His impeccable stats are a proof of his achievements and it wouldn't be a surprise if he breaks several records in future.",

      "bio": "There is no denying the fact that Shaheen Afridi's potential is scaringly infinite. Blessed with a tall gangling frame and the ability to bowl really fast, Afridi also like his famous namesake can strike the ball really hard with the bat in hand. Add to all this his variety as a left-arm bowler and you know why there is immense excitement around this man in Pakistan. Born in a family of seven, Shaheen is the youngest of the lot and arguably, the most skilled as well. Despite being extremely passionate about cricket from his childhood, he was mostly into tennis-ball cricket before being guided into the real deal by his eldest brother Riaz, a one-Test wonder for Pakistan, who has also been Shaheen's inspiration and mentor. <br/>  <br/> The transition has been extremely smooth for Shaheen who has rose up the ranks briskly in real quick time. Pakistan Super League has also helped, the platform allowing youngsters like him to rub shoulders with some of the best in business. The exposure has made Shaheen a tougher man and he is still in his teenage. He is still very raw and his domestic career has just taken off recently but there is enough to suggest that he could be a menace in the coming years, depending on how Pakistan handle him. He made his international debut during the T20I series at home against West Indies in 2018 and impressed with his skill set. After being in the radar for a while, he earned his maiden ODI call up for the Asia Cup in the same year. <br/>  <br/> Shaheen also had an impressive campaign in the 2019 World Cup, despite not playing all the games. He generated good pace and also doled out fine variations at the death, ending up with 16 wickets in the tourney. Shaheen was one of the few shining lights for Pakistan who endured a disappointing tournament otherwise. Although he made his Test debut at the start of 2019, it shall be interesting to see how the PCB and the team management control his work load, given the youngster's injury-prone nature. At the moment, it seems wise to preserve him for the shorter formats where he is a deadly customer. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

From Peshawar College team at the age of 17 to Pakistan national team at the age of 22 - it was an incredible hard-working journey for Rizwan. <br/>  <br/> In the earlier stages of his Under-19 career, he found it hard to cope up with the pressure of playing white-ball cricket. He, however, managed to overcome tough times with the help of his domestic coaches and mentors. After an 87-ball 103 from Rizwan steered Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Fighters to clinch thePentangular One Day Cup with a six-wicket win in the final against Baluchistan Warriors, he pushed his case further for claiming a spot in the national side. Moreover, Peshawar Panthers became national T20 champions in 2014 and 2015 with Rizwan playing a pivotal role. <br/>  <br/> A big fan of the Brazil Football team, Rizwan is a full time wicket-keeper as well as a super fielder, anywhere on the ground. A busy batsman, Rizwan buzzes like a bee in the ears of the opposition while in full flow. He scored a valiant 67 off 58 balls in a losing cause in his debut game against Bangladesh in 2015. The retirements of Younis Khan and Misbah after the 2015 WC had opened up slots in the middle order and Rizwan had a dream start. He even landed a Test debut in New Zealand during Pakistan's 2016 tour although he played just that solitary game with a duck in his maiden innings. <br/>  <br/> It did seem that Rizwan would go on to become a mainstay of Pakistan's limited-overs outfit considering his attacking stroke play and wicket-keeping skills which would bring tremendous balance to the side's composition. However, his form dipped and what followed was a series of low scores. Pakistan's disastrous tour of Australia in 2016-17 was probably the push that the selectors needed to nip out the non-performers and Rizwan found himself out of the side, but he did make a comeback following that. <br/>  <br/> Along with Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan has had several match defining partnerships in the shorter formats and with age by his side, he can also be a regular member in the longest format. A solid top-order batter in T20Is and a reliable middle-order batter in ODIs, Rizwan has the ability to win games on his own. He's in his early 30s, but given his talent and experience, he is going to be a vital part of Pakistan's set-up for many more years to come..",

      "bio": "Misbah-ul-Haq will be forever remembered by cricket fans for his audacious paddle-scoop that cost Pakistan the inaugural T20 World Cup against India. That one moment of madness from him, ensured that he will forever be castigated for his mistake, despite having taken his side so close to the target when there seemed to be no hope.  <br/>  <br/> Misbah first caught the attention of the selectors in 2002 when he made truckloads of runs in the domestic scene. He played well in the tri-nation tournament in Nairobi, but subsequently, his form deserted him and he was soon sidelined from the national side.  <br/>  <br/> With the departure of Inzamam-ul-Haq, and with the solid weight of domestic and county runs behind his name, Misbah made another comeback into the national team in 2007. He finished as Pakistan's best player in the T20 World Cup in 2007 and carried that form to India, where he made a couple of hundreds and finished with 464 runs in the three-match Test series.  <br/>  <br/> More than the number of runs, it was the cool and calm manner that he negotiated all that India threw at him that impressed everybody. Suddenly, he was proclaimed to to be the natural successor to Inzamam and a future captain. The year 2008 began with some high points for Misbah as he was elevated to the post of vice - captain of the Pakistan team and was awarded a Grade A contract. But his form slumped dramatically and was axed from the side from all three formats of the game. He didn't feature in the disastrous trip to England in 2010 and was made captain of the Test side against South Africa in late 2010.  <br/>  <br/> Misbah led the side to a 0-0 draw against the Proteas and then achieved a 1-0 series victory when Pakistan toured New Zealand in early 2011. He was again roundly criticised for his painfully slow innings during the World Cup semi-final loss to India, but he chose not to respond to any of those criticisms. After Shahid Afridi's axing as the ODI skipper in 2012, he was named the captain of the Pakistan team, which completed a clean sweep (3-0) against the then No.1 Test side England.  <br/>  <br/> Misbah had a fantastic 2012-13 domestic season. He led his team,  the Faisalabad Wolves, to the T20 Championship title and they also qualified for the Champions League T20. Under his able leadership, they won all the domestic tournaments (Twenty20, First-Class and list-A) in the season 2012-13.  During that time, he also led his country to a famous ODI series victory against their arch-rivals India. <br/>  <br/> Misbah's captaincy came under serious scrutiny after Pakistan lost the ODI series against South Africa in the UAE. However, the PCB backed him and declared him to be the captain until the 2015 World Cup. Pakistan took their revenge against the Proteas by churning out a brilliant performance in South Africa soon after. They took the series 2-1, becoming the first sub-continent team to beat South Africa in a bilateral ODI series in their own den. This historic win won Misbah many accolades across the country. Pakistan replicated their strong performance against Sri Lanka, winning the ODI series comfortably and squaring the Test series 1-1, where Misbah played a crucial role in the third Test. He was a stand-out performer in 2013, scoring over 1,000 runs in a calendar year.  <br/>  <br/> There is always a cloud hanging around Misbah's captaincy, be it for losing the 2014 Asia Cup final, or the first two ODIs against Australia in the UAE. Misbah even sat out of the third game against Australia, just to take a break and to think about his future. All the questions were answered, when he led Pakistan to a 2-0 Test series win against Australia and levelled the Test series 1-1 versus New Zealand. Although, under him, Pakistan lost the ODI series to the Black Caps, the selectors showed faith in him and named him as the skipper for the 2015 World Cup. As soon as the squad was announced for the, Misbah decided that he will retire after the mega-event. <br/>  <br/> Questions were raised about his retirement from all forms after Pakistan's heart-breaking loss against Australia in the quarter-final. However, Misbah carried on with the five-day format and even helped Pakistan become the No. 1 Test side for the first time in their history, after a victory at The Oval against England in 2016. However, he had poor outings Down Under later that year and in early 2017. On April 6, 2017, Misbah announced that he will bid adieu to international cricket after the three-match Test series against West Indies. <br/>  <br/> The farewell series for Misbah was historical for Pakistan as they sealed their first-ever Test series win in the Caribbean. The series saw a thrilling finish as the visitors were able to gift their beloved captain the ideal send off from international cricket. Despite the exit from national duties, Misbah continues to play First-class cricket and shall also be a part of the T20 Leagues like PSL and BPL where he shall also be captaining the respective teams. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> <b>Interesting facts:</b> Misbah has a Masters Degree in Business Administration. <br/>  <br/> Misbah went past Wasim Akram, becoming the player to have the most ODI runs to his name without scoring a century.  <br/>  <br/> Misbah also is the most successful Pakistan Test captain, he went past Imran Khan, who had 13 wins under his name.  <br/>  <br/> Misbah recorded a 56-ball hundred against Australia in 2014 - then the joint fastest hundred in Tests, sharing the record with Sir Viv Richards.  <br/>  <br/> <b>By Cricbuzz Staff</b>",

      "bio": "Since the advent of the 21st century, a lot about Pakistan and its cricket has changed barring of course - Younis Khan. <b>The Younis Khan on drive</b> is as much as a reality as are death and taxes. His bucket like hands at slips worked on an unreal montony mode, plucking blinders at will. Younis's hop-shuffle across the sticks looked like an exaggeration to the purists but bloated were his numbers as well. His poker face during tense situations was never testimony to his uncanny cricketing grey cells. Cricket is fanatic and frenetic in Pakistan, this man bought a sense of calm. He tried to be the lull amidst the storm, both on and off the field and succeeded to a large extent. Younis walked into retirement in May 2017 after churning out 10,099 runs in 118 Tests. Not to forget more than a half-a-dozen thousand runs in ODIs as well.  <br/>  <br/> The ever-smiling right hander from Mardan, Younis Khan came into the Pakistani side in an ODI game against Sri Lanka in 2000. His Test debut, came in the same series and turned out to be a memorable one, as he scored a fighting century in the second innings, which unfortunately ended in a losing cause. Though he didn't set the world ablaze with his batting over the next few years, Younis managed to remain in the team thanks to his ability to rotate strike and play the role of a sheet anchor in a batting order filled with stroke-makers. He was one of the few players who managed to retain his spot in the squad after a disastrous World Cup in 2003, but lost it soon after following a poor home series against Bangladesh and South Africa. Younis returned to the ODI squad that faced arch rivals India, but struggled to regain his Test spot. <br/> \t <br/> It was in October 2004 that Younis scripted a major turnaround. Chosen to face the visiting Sri Lankans, Younis made the most of the opportunity as he scored a century batting at number 3. He made the spot his own as he emerged the highest run getter in the 0-3 whitewash in Australia soon after. Things became better as Younis was appointed vice- captain for the tour to India. He started slowly but ended the series with a match-winning 267 at Bangalore in the final Test, which helped Pakistan square the series. He took a particular liking to the Indian bowling attack and went on to make 3 more Test centuries against them in the next two years. His average of 106 is the highest for any Pakistani batsmen against India. <br/>  <br/> Younis first led Pakistan in a disastrous series against the West Indies in 2005, but also had his good times as he captained Pakistan to a win against India in Karachi the next year. However, he created a controversy in September, when he refused to \"be a dummy captain\" when he was offered the post for the Champions Trophy. However, a day later, he returned to lead the side to a first round exit. Younis was once again offered the post after an embarrassing first round exit from the 2007 World Cup, but refused it citing strain and personal reasons. Despite being a reluctant leader, the post seemed to follow him as the PCB once again made him skipper, replacing Shoaib Malik in January 2009. <br/>  <br/> This time, Younis accepted the offer and soon after, led Pakistan to a title victory in the 2009 T20 World Cup. However, the musical chairs continued as many senior players revolted against Younis' leadership. He resigned from the post after a series against New Zealand in Sharjah and took a break, only to be called back midway to bolster a struggling line up for the ODI series in Australia. His career seemed to come to an abrupt end when he, along with Mohammad Yousuf, were banned for \"infighting\" by the PCB in March 2010. However, things became better and Younis returned to the national squad for the series against South Africa in October, 2010. He made a strong return in both forms during the series, including an unbeaten century which helped Pakistan to a draw. He went on to represent Pakistan in the 2011 World Cup, and remains a permanent fixture in both the ODI and Test squads. <br/>  <br/> After being overlooked for the ODI series against Australia, this is what Younis had to say, \"If they say I have no future than I will step aside in all formats don’t pick me even for Tests. I am willing to step aside for five months before the World Cup. let them make a new team but if they don’t succeed than the selectors should be held accountable.\" However, things changed dramatically and it was Younis himself, who changed things around. He continued playing Tests and kept racking up runs at will. In the 7 Tests that he played since August 2014, against Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand, he amassed 928 runs, which included 5 hundreds and 3 came versus Australia. He also has the most tons by a Pakistan batsman in Tests, going past Inzamam's 25. All these factors contributed in him being recalled to the ODI team, he played the 5-match series against New Zealand and scored his 7th ODI ton in the fourth game. Younis was also named in the 15-man squad for the 2015 World Cup but failed to impress as he managed only 43 runs from 3 games and was dropped mid-way into the tourney. He announced his ODI retirement in November 2015 after having announced his T20I retirement in 2009. <br/>  <br/> <i>The stat bucket of Younis reads:-</i> <br/> * Only Pakistan player to score 10,000+ Test runs <br/> * 10099 runs & 34 hundreds - both the most for Pakistan in Tests <br/> * Six double hundreds by him is the joint most by a Pakistan player alongside Javed Miandad <br/> * Only player to score Test hundreds in all 11 countries <br/> * One of the two players to average above 45 in all four innings; has 5 hundreds in fourth innings, the most by any. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Karthik Lakshmanan, Akshay Maanay and Kumar Abhisekh Das</b> ",

      "bio": "Shahid Afridi, Pakistan's allrounder, is as enigmatic a player as there ever was. He came as a 16-year-old into the Pakistan ODI squad and was unfazed by all the speculation regarding his real age. In only his second ODI against Sri Lanka in 1996, he blasted his way to a 37-ball century. For more than 17 years, it remained the fastest century in the ODI format before Corey Anderson broke the record in January 2014. Afridi's sparkling ton came after he was sent in as a pinch-hitter at one drop and after being picked in the team as a leg-spinner to replace the injured Mushtaq Ahmed! <br/>  <br/> For the next few years, Afridi's batting took prominence after hitting that ton. He soon became a crowd-puller for just his eccentric batting. As entertaining as it was to the viewers, it sometimes proved to be infuriating to his teammates. His then captain, Wasim Akram, had repeatedly asked him not to throw his wicket away, but nothing could change Afridi's ways. This reckless streak extended to the highest format, the Test matches, and he was quickly sorted out by his opponents. After having some limited success in the longest format, Afridi quickly realized that he lacked the temperament for the same and announced his retirement from Tests in 2006, after having played just 26 games. <br/>  <br/> He was more successful in the limited-overs format, where he influenced many games with a stunning cameo. After a while, his career completed a full circle as his quickish leg-breaks gained more importance. His tendency to rush through his overs was almost as influential. He mixed it up by bowling googlies and the quicker ones. On occasions, he even delivered the conventional off-break. This was interspersed with some stunning knocks such as the one against India in 2005 when he got to his hundred in 45 balls. This lethal combination made him one of the most valuable players going around in the shorter forms of the game. In fact, Sanath Jayasuriya and Afridi are the only two men to have made over 4,000 runs and taken over 300 wickets. <br/>   <br/> The advent of T20 saw a rise in Afridi's value. He was named the Man of the Series in the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007 when Pakistan reached the final. He also scored fifties in both the semi-final and the final of the 2009 T20 World Cup and this time around, it helped Pakistan win the tournament. Soon after, he was named the captain of the T20 side. In 2010, after Mohammad Yousuf's exit, he was handed over the ODI reigns too. He even returned briefly to Tests to lead Pakistan in England, but retired immediately after the first game at Lord's, re-affirming that he was not suited for Tests. This did not hold him back from leading the Pakistan ODI team in the 2011 World Cup that saw him at the peak of his bowling prowess. He emerged as the joint highest wicket-taker along with Zaheer Khan. Both had 21 wickets. <br/>  <br/> Controversies have dogged him throughout his career. After the age speculations died down, he was banned for two ODIs and a Test in 2005 after cameras caught him deliberately scuffing up the pitch with his boots in a Test against England. That was not the end of it, in 2010 he was found guilty of ball tampering when he was caught biting the ball in a ODI against Australia. A ban for two T20Is followed. In 2011 after a tour of the West Indies and following a rift with Pakistan coach, Waqar Younis, Afridi was sacked as the captain of the squad. His response to what he saw as unfair treatment being meted out by the board was to announce a conditional retirement. He soon sought a NOC from the PCB that would allow him to play for Hampshire. It was granted after both parties agreed to an out of court settlement. <br/>  <br/> In October 2011, Afridi withdrew his conditional retirement and was selected for the Sri Lanka tour. In the fourth ODI, Afridi became the only cricketer to score a half-century and take five wickets on two separate occasions in ODIs. He also became the first person to score a fifty in his 50th T20 International in 2012. During the first ODI against West Indies in July 2013, Afridi produced an exceptional all-round performance. He scored an aggressive 76 to help Pakistan reach a respectable total of 224 and annihilated West Indies with a remarkable bowling spell of 7-12. In late 2013, Afridi had a decent run with the ball against both South Africa and Sri Lanka. <br/>  <br/> Severely criticized for his lack of quality performances in recent times, Afridi silenced his critics in the 2014 Asia Cup by delivering outstanding back-to-back performances. In what was quoted to be a virtual semi-final against India, he hit a quick-fire 34 not out, giving Pakistan a thrilling last-over win. He bettered his previous performance in the next game against Bangladesh, equalling his own record for the second-fastest ODI fifty for the third time. Both these performances not only ensured Pakistan a spot in the final but also India's elimination from the tournament. Unfortunately, Afridi suffered a hamstring injury during that time. He did not get a chance to bat in the Asia Cup final against Sri Lanka and was mediocre with the ball as well. Afridi played some useful hands with both bat and ball in the World T20, but could not get Pakistan to qualify for the semi-finals. <br/>  <br/> After Hafeez resigned from T20 captaincy, the Pakistani selectors went back to Afridi to lead them again. He also led the team when Misbah ul Haq decided to take a break in the third ODI against Australia. Afridi, always known for his irresponsible shots, curbed those instincts against New Zealand. The allrounder batted sensibly in almost every game, he made two fifties to show for it. Afridi, with his all-round skills, was expected to be a force to reckon with in the 2015 World Cup in Australia-New Zealand and got cameos in nearly every game as well. Pakistan ended with a quarterfinal finish and Afridi retired from the 50-over format, insisting that he would continue in the shortest format of the game. <br/>  <br/> There were talks that Afridi was appointed captain in T20Is solely because he had informed the PCB regarding his retirement after the 2016 World T20. While there wasn't any clarity on this topic, it certainly did cause confusion within the team and in the Board. Pakistan's poor performances in the 2016 World T20 was the last straw and Afridi saw himself dropped after the tournament after the expected 'retirement' hadn't come.Afridi became the butt of social media jokes for his penchant for retirements that never lasted long. He retired five times in his career, only to return on four occasions. However, in February 2017, he announced it for one last time and decided to bid adieu to international cricket. Afridi has been enjoying his time in the franchise T20 leagues across the globe. He seems to have found his mojo back in T20 cricket as showcased by his performances in the 2017 Natwest T20 Blast in England where shone for Hampshire. A blistering century at the top of the order showed the world glimpses of his potential while his crafty leg spin bowling continued to create an impact. The BPL season has also seen him making a mark for the Dhaka Dynamites. Leaving the cricketing part aside, the aura that Afridi brought to the game was and shall always remain unparalleled. He will never change and so, till he retires from all forms of cricket, expect him to entertain the crowds to the fullest. <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "Saeed Ajmal is one of the late bloomers who has developed into one of the most pivotal spin bowlers for Pakistan during the last couple of years. Armed with a mesmerizing doosra and a big heart, Ajmal is one of the best spinners in the country and has shown his mettle on the international stage as well.  <br/>  <br/> He made his debut in the Asia Cup of 2008 against India and he impressed with the amount of spin that he generated. It was in the T20 format of the game where Ajmal showed his class. He demonstrated it during the 2009 T20 World Cup in England. Bamboozling the batsmen with his off-spin and doosra, he finished the tournament as the joint second highest wicket taker with 12 wickets. His exploits, along with Shahid Afridi's all-round brilliance helped Pakistan win the trophy.  <br/>  <br/> His excellent showing in the T20 World Cup earned him a spot in the Test squad for the tour to Sri Lanka. He excelled immediately by picking up 14 wickets in three matches. He had an excellent time in the Champions Trophy in South Africa and continued with his excellent showing in the ODI series against New Zealand at Abu Dhabi.  <br/>  <br/> In 2009, the ICC called him for suspect action, but he was soon cleared from it and he continued to trouble the batsmen, with his bagful of tricks. <br/>  <br/> He continued to excel in the shorter format of the game. He picked up 4/26 to knock South Africa out of the competition in the 2010 T20 World Cup. However, the semi-final against Australia was a nightmarish experience. Michael Hussey stamped his authority and clouted him for three sixes in the final over bowled by him to win a cliff-hanger. Ajmal was heart-broken but moved on and continued to be consistent.  <br/>  <br/> In Tests, he picked up his first five wicket haul against England at Birmingham in 2010 when he picked up 5/82. He contributed with the bat by scoring a fifty that was punctuated by the ball hitting more of his body than the bat. He had a good ODI series which followed but was surprisingly picked for only three matches in the 2011 World Cup. He made the West Indies clueless in the quarter-final and in the semi-final troubled Sachin Tendulkar to a great extent without any luck. Ajmal has grown from strength to strength and had an outstanding Test series in the West Indies. In the two match series, he picked up 20 wickets, including his first ever 10 wicket haul at Guyana. <br/>  <br/> He ripped through the England strong batting order in 2012, which Pakistan won 3-0 by taking 24 wickets in 3 games at an average of 14.70. Ajmal was signed by Adelaide Strikers for the 2012 Big Bash League in Australia. He continued his golden run with the ball and was one of the leading wicket takers in ODIs in 2013. Ajmal had a fantastic start to 2014 as he picked up 11 wickets in the Asia Cup, including three crucial ones in the final against Sri Lanka but ended up on the losing side. Ajmal had a mixed 2014 T20 WC, he picked up 4 wickets in 4 games but was expensive in the crucial match against West Indies. In the end, Pakistan lost that game and failed to qualify for the semi-finals.   <br/>  <br/> With his unreadable doosra and variations in flight, Ajmal is currently one of the most feared spinners of his time. <br/>  <br/> by <b>Cricbuzz staff</b> <br/> <i>As of April 2014</i> <br/> ",

      "bio": "A lean onto the front foot in amalgamation of the high elbow giving way to a serene cover drive describes Mohammad Hafeez, the best. A tuck or a clip off the pads looks equally elegant when Hafeez is at work. And so does the flat darts which hard to score off in the limited overs. To complete his repertoire, he stands at point to intervene the fiery cut shots. A man who can walk into any side, Hafeez took his time, good seven years to be a man for all formats.  <br/>  <br/> An opening batsman and a more than decent off-spinner, Mohammad Hafeez, came into the Pakistan side after their disastrous exit from the 2003 World Cup. He made a promising start to his Test career, scoring a half-century on debut against Bangladesh and followed it up with a century in the next match. His performances though were more troughs than crests and he had to sit out of the Test unit for two 3 year periods. Once between 2003-2006 and then from 2007-2010. But strong domestic performances brought him back in November 2010 and since then he has been a permanent in Test line-up. <br/>  <br/> The numbers in ODIs also remained dwarfed with a few notable exceptions far and few in between in his formative years at the top level. But like the Tests, the ODI numbers also were bolstered upon his return to the side in September 2010. 11 ODI tons(all of them away) from 2011-2015 at the top of the order ensured Pakistan post Saeed Anwar's retirement had someone elegant as well as solid to counter the opposition. More than 100 wickets at an economy rate of tad over 4 only made him more indispensable till his action was questioned by the ICC in June 2015. He remodelled his action and made it to the ODI side which toured Australia in early 2017. Initially left out of the squad, he replaced an injured Azhar Ali.  <br/>  <br/> Nicknamed as 'the professor', Mohammad Hafeez has captained Pakistan in all formats. Once in Tests and twice in ODIs. But it is the T20Is where he was at the helm for a decent period of time. He skippered the Pakistani unit in 29 T20I games, winning 17 and losing 11 of them. But that period involved two World cups in 2012, where they made it to the semis and in 2014, where they didn't qualify for the semis for the first time. That unsuccessful tourney brought down curtains on his captaincy career. As a T20 player, he was awarded the Man of the Series award in 2012 against India in a 2-match T20I series which ended in a deadlock. <br/>  <br/> World Cup through the years: <br/>  <br/> Mohammad Hafeez is all set to make a comeback in the 2019 World Cup after missing out in the last World Cup due to a calf injury. Before that, Hafeez was a part of Pakistan's World Cup campaign in 2007 and 2011 World Cup. Hafeez just like his team was disappointing in the 2007 campaign. He chipped in with a couple of wickets against West Indies but as a batsman, he flopped and was dropped from the team for Pakistan's final match. In the 2011 World Cup, Pakistan did much better and so did Hafeez. He ended up as Pakistan's third highest run-getter but lacked the requisite consistency. Against India, in a crucial semi-final, Hafeez gave Pakistan an ideal start and was looking in his elements. But the pressure of big occasion got to him and he was dismissed playing a dreadful shot. His dismissal opened up the gates for India and they restricted Pakistan from chasing 261. Hafeez will go into 2019 World Cup as one of the most experienced players in the Pakistan line-up. His role will be different from the previous World Cups as he will be playing in the middle order instead of an opener. Hafeez is a very handy off-spin prospect too especially against the left-handers.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> <b>By Kumar Abhisekh Das</b>",

      "bio": "Jack of all trades, master of none; no one fits the bill as perfectly as Shoaib Malik does. A career spanning almost two decades began in the form of an off-spinner and would most likely culminate, whenever it does as one of the most dependable batsman in the shorter versions of the game that Pakistan has ever had. A water-tight defence backed by some handsome horizontal bat shots and lofted drives make the man from Sialkot, a spectator's delight. Most part of his career though has been a game of musical chairs as far as his batting number was concerned. He has flirted with every batting position - from 1 to 10. A solid opener, a dependable number 3, a workman middle order bat and a manufactured slogger, he has seen it all. In the sub-continent he walks on thin ice and away from the ice becomes thinner for him to dwell upon - a common consensus amongst the cricketing experts on Shoaib. But criticism has hardly had its ways against the cocooned and soft-spoken Malik.  <br/>  <br/> A 17-year-old Shoaib Malik debuted against West Indies in October 1999. His bowling style was a mirror motion picture of Saqlain Mushtaq and he scalped 2 wickets in his first game. But with time, batting took precedence and the first time he was promoted to number 4 in the batting order, Shoaib grabbed the bull by its horns and got a hundred against West Indies at Sharjah. A couple of games later, he was asked to open and he vindicated the move with a splendorous ton against the Kiwis at Lahore. The bowling though continued to add to his dimension but received a jolt in 2004, when he was reported for a suspect action, only to be cleared after a few months. His batting though was enough a reason in the shorter formats to keep his place despite losing a bit of his potency thanks to his re-modeled action.  <br/>  <br/> Shoaib's love for India is second to none. His three top scores in ODIs are all against India. The standouts being - 143 in 2004 at Colombo, Sri Lanka in an Asia Cup game and a majestic 128, where he literally 'cut' his way through the Indian bowling attack to dismantle them in a Champions Trophy game in 2009 at Centurion. No wonder his ODI average against India is almost 50, compared to his career average which is in the mid 30s.  <br/>  <br/> His performance in the whites was a lot to be desired and didn't really seem convincing. He debuted in 2001 in Tests and after sparring appearances retired in late 2015 against England. He had come back to the Test team after almost 5 years and celebrated that with a double hundred in his comeback Test. But he decided to hang his boots after the third Test saying he wanted to focus completely on the shorter formats. A double ton and a couple of ducks in his swansong series talks a lot about the oscillation of inconsistency that he was as a Test performer. His greatest moment as a Test player though was a dogged 148* off 369 balls against Sri Lanka in 2006, where he batted an entire day to save the day for Pakistan. That was the first of the three tons he scored in the whites in his 35 appearances. An average of 35.14 to end with was a major disappointment for someone who had the resolve, technique and the shots to succeed in the premier format of the game.  <br/>  <br/> Malik's tryst as a skipper were mostly under heavy weather in his 18-month period as the ODI captain and was sacked in January 2009 after a humiliating loss to Sri Lanka at Lahore. Though the late Bob Woolmer always held his cricketing brain in high regards, Malik never could gel well with other senior members of the team during his tenure as reported by many sections of the media. He was banned by the PCB for a year post the disastrous 2009-10 tour to Australia for his rift with the senior players. The ban though was revoked after a few months.  <br/>  <br/> His T20 exploits are well documented and he led Pakistan to the finale in the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007 and was a key member of the T20 World Cup triumph in 2009 in England. Though he was out of favour for the ODIs for a period of 2 years after the Champions Trophy in 2013, it has never been the case in the shortest format. He plays for Karachi Kings in the PSL and has also played in the BBL and CPL for Hobart Hurricanes and Barbados Tridents respectively.  <br/>  <br/> He was dropped from the ODI side after a poor campaign for Pakistan in the 2013 Champions Trophy but once he made a comeback post the 2015 World Cup, his average and strike rate have swelled up. A strong desire to represent Pakistan till the 2019 World T20 will keep him in good stead and that augurs well for the Pakistan limited overs team. <br/>  <br/> World Cup through the years: <br/>  <br/> Shoaib Malik has confirmed that the upcoming 2019 World Cup will be his last global event in the 50-over-format. He made his debut for Pakistan in 1999 and considering his high-profile stature in Pakistan cricket one would have assumed that he would have featured in at least three or four World Cups so far. But the fact is he has only represented Pakistan once in World Cups and that was in the disastrous 2007 campaign. He was probably one of the only shining light in Pakistan's campaign as he scored a blistering 62 off 54 balls in the opening match against West India. However, his contribution didn't prove to be enough as Pakistan ended up on the losing side. In this World Cup, Malik would be playing the crucial role of finisher and Pakistan would count on Malik's experience to get them over the finishing line in a tense match. <br/>  <br/> <b>by Kumar Abhisekh Das</b> and <b>Nikhil Jadhav</b>",

      "bio": "Prodigy turned offender - words that were associated with Amir after he was banned by the ICC for five years in 2010. He divides the opinions in the cricketing world like few have in the history of the game. Upon his comeback, a lot of hullabaloo occurred in the cricketing circles. From etching his name on the Lords Honour board to being a prisoner at Dorset, the sojourn has been nothing less than a fairy-tale turning into an ugly unprecedented nightmare.  On his best days, Amir could nick off Sachin Tendulkar with his nagging outswingers and on his worst, like the one at Lords, he bowled an enormous no-ball to take his career into a dungeon. But life did give him a second chance and in January 2016, Amir came back for the tour to New Zealand.  <br/>  <br/> Amir was spotted as a prospect by Akram in 2007 and he remarked that Amir was a much clever bowler than he was at the age of 18. His first major achievement was during Pakistan's U-19 tour to England where he picked up eight wickets at an average of 16.37. In the tri-nation tournament in Sri Lanka featuring the England U-19 and Sri Lanka U-19, he snapped up nine wickets at an average of 11.2 to establish himself as a name to be reckoned with. In his first full year in Pakistan's domestic cricket in 2009, he picked up 55 wickets for National Bank of Pakistan and that earned him a call to the Pakistan team for the 2009 T20 World Cup in England. His pace and accuracy were key to the team's fortunes as they won the T20 World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Amir made a good start to his ODI career as well and possessed a solid technique with the bat lower down the order. In the ODI against New Zealand at Abu Dhabi, he created history when he achieved the then highest score for a No.10 batsman in an ODI. His 103 run stand with Saeed Ajmal was only the second occasion when the last wicket pair had strung a partnership for the last wicket but it was not enough as Pakistan fell short by seven runs.  <br/>  <br/> He had an insipid start to his Test career as he picked up only six wickets in the three Tests against Sri Lanka. However, on the tours to Australia and England, he excelled. Against Australia at the MCG, he picked up his first five wicket haul while his haul of 5/52 against England at the Oval in 2010 gave Pakistan victory after nine years in England. He etched his name on the Lords Honours Board when he picked up 6/84 in the fourth Test, but it was the beginning of a painful period in Amir's life.  <br/>  <br/> In an investigation by the News of the World tabloid, it was revealed that Amir, along with his team-mate, Mohammad Asif, deliberately bowled no-balls in the Lords Test in return for a payment from a betting syndicate. This resulted in Amir being banned by the ICC under the provisions of their Anti-Corruption Code. In February 2011, Amir was handed a five year ban and decided to appeal the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) in Switzerland. In November 2011, Amir was convicted at Southwark Crown Court for conspiracy to cheat at gambling and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments. Amir was sentenced to six months in a Young Offenders Institution in Feltham, after which he was transferred to a Young Offenders Institution in Dorset. He was released in early 2012.  <br/>  <br/> Ever since his return to the side, Amir has had to deal with constant comparisons of his younger self and that he has lost out on a lot of the steam that once turned the heat on the batsmen to make them sweat. But the Indo-Pak Asia cup game in 2016 was a silent reminder to his critics and fans alike, he can be as devastating when he is in the zone. The inswinging curler, the slanting away swinger, the deadly yorker are a few of the weapons in his repertoire that can befuddle any batting line up. He might never scale the peaks that he once attained but if he does, Pakistan's surge back to the top in every format is just a formality. The good-turned-bad boy in the minds of the public can force another u-turn if his ball does the talking. <br/>  <br/> by <b>Kumar Abhisekh Das & Siddharth Vishwanathan</b>",

      "bio": "The characteristics of a keeper batsman in the last 1980's and 90's - chirpy, safe pair of hands and handy with the bat. Sarfraz as a keeper is an embodiment of the glovesmen from the eras gone by. As a batsman though, he stays in the present. A busy bee at the crease, he loves to churn out runs at a fastish clip. For a country who have had a strong lineage of keepers in the form of Wasim Bari, Moin Khan, Rashid Latif and Umar Akmal. Sarfraz has so far carved a niche for himself. He is street smart and thrives under pressure situations. <br/>  <br/> No wonder he was handed over the reigns of the ODI side after Azhar Ali had a tumultuous time as a skipper post the retirement of Misbah Ul Haq. A committed and gutsy keeper batsman, Sarfraz is not new to the role of captaincy as he had led Pakistan under-19 team to triumph in the 2006 edition. Pakistan then became the first team to defend their title as their colts had won it in 2004 as well. In the finals of the 2006 championship, Pakistan were up against arch rivals India and managed to defend a petty 109 to win the cup. They skittled the Indians out for 71 to defend their title in the most pompous way possible.  <br/>  <br/> Sarfraz's introduction to both ODI and Test cricket though was out of the blue. He was picked for the bilateral ODI series in India in 2007 and in Tests was flown to Australia during the 2009-10 tour for the last Test at Hobart. The one-off Test was followed by a tour to oblivion for almost the next 3 years. His place in the ODI side was also far from being secured till he rescued Pakistan with a valiant 46* against Bangladesh in the 2012 Asia Cup. Pakistan went on to win the game by a wafer thin margin of 2 runs. Those 46 runs gave a prism of hope to one nation and despair to the other as the Bangladeshis stuttered at the final hurdle.  <br/>  <br/> After the selectors completed their musical chair of handing the keeping duties to the Akmal brothers( Adnan and Kamran), Sarfraz was brought back into the Test team for the tour to South Africa in 2013. There were visible struggles for him but he seemed to have gotten better as the tour progressed. The tides changed for good and the 2014-15 season turned out to be a fairytale one for Ahmed. He notched up an away ton against Lanka, and tons against Australia and New Zealand in consecutive Test series. Even away tours to England and Australia were not intimidating to the pint-sized entertainer, who wears his heart on his sleeves.  <br/>  <br/> Initially ignored as a first choice keeper in favour of Umar Akmal for the first part of the 2015 World Cup, Sarfraz was promoted to open in a must win game against South Africa and he delivered with a gutsy run-a-ball 49. His exploits won him the Man of the Match award and he repeated the feat with his maiden century against Ireland in the very next game. That tilted the faith of the selectors in his favour and a year later he was handed the captaincy for the T20 format. His swashbuckling ways earning him plaudits more often than not has been strength and very rarely a reason for his downfall. <br/>  <br/> The numbers continue to grow in magnitude for Sarfraz and his keenness to win at any cost serves Pakistan good post Misbah's retirement in Tests. Sarfraz being a permanent member of the Test team will be a likely candidate to don the leadership role but Azhar Ali's candidature will also pose a bit of headache for the selectors. A flamboyant leader of men or a docile skipper who shields his emotions well. The ball is in the court of the selectors. A fruitful Champions Trophy will do his chances no bad.  <br/>  <br/> In T20s, Sarfraz has also been potent and lead the Quetta Gladiators. His team have been finalists in both seasons - 2016 and 2017. Being the skipper of the national T20 team as well, Sarfraz's numbers are bound to swell up as he loves playing as a floater in the batting order. <br/>  <br/> <b>World Cup through the years:</b> <br/>  <br/> Sarfaraz Ahmed became a national icon in Pakistan after he led his team to a fairytale Champions Trophy victory against India in 2017. His next biggest challenge is the World Cup. If he can replicate Champions Trophy effort and win Pakistan the World Cup after 27 years then his stature in a cricket-frenzy nation will touch new heights, probably at par with Imran Khan. Sarfaraz started the last World Cup on the bench, not featuring in the first four out of six matches. But his fortune took a 360-degree turn from there and by the end of the World Cup, Sarfraz was the only Pakistan player to score a hundred in that tournament and he bagged a Man of the Match award too against South Africa. The challenges in the 2019 World Cup would be far greater for him and how he would maintain his persona under immense pressure situation would play a crucial role in the outcome of Pakistan's World Cup campaign.   <br/>  <br/> <b>by Kumar Abhisekh Das</b>",

      "bio": "Shadab Khan born in 1998 in Mianwali has already created ripples with his leg-breaks, and more than ripples with his wrong'uns at the Under-19 level. Hailing from the land of stalwarts like Imran Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq, Shadab moved to Rawalpindi at the age of 12 and started picking up the nuances of the sport whilst playing for his school team. He further accelerated his growth and whilst training at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore, and gathered some valuable wisdom from former greats like Abdul Qadir and Mushtaq Ahmed. <br/>  <br/> Shadab was rising through the ranks and polishing himself up alarmingly fast, and looked all set to be a stereotypical precocious talent from Pakistan. He was promptly selected for the Under-19 World Cup in 2016 and he rewarded the faith of the selectors by topping the wicket charts in the tournament, picking up 11 wickets from 6 games at a commendable average of 19.  <br/>  <br/> Unlike the modern limited-overs spinner, Shadab bowls with a more loopy trajectory and uses his wit and guile to fox the batsmen in the air. He uses the crease well bowling from close to the stumps as well as from a wider angle, to make the batsman recalibrate his eye-line. His consistent performances ensured defending champions Islamabad United drafted him in for the second edition of the PSL. Shadab impressed immediately with his wily variations and flight and ended the campaign with 9 wickets from 8 games. In addition, he maintains high levels of fitness and is a terrific fielder at point, in stark contrast to the stereotypical stick-to-your-thing Pakistani spinner.  <br/>  <br/> Shadab had done enough to prompt the selectors who awarded him a with T20I cap against the Windies in March 2017. He embraced his opportunity as well, with figures of 4-0-7-3 on debut, which won him the Man of the Match award, and the distinction for the most economical spell on T20I debut. He already has 3 such awards in his first 10 T20Is. He also has one man-of-the-match award in ODIs for his 3-wicket-haul and a composed fifty, in the course of which he exhibited maturity beyond his years and pulled off a nerve-wracking chase against Sri Lanka.  <br/>  <br/> He was also a part of the Pakistan team that won the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 in England. He was given a Test cap against the West Indies the following month, in which he took just one wicket. However, the teenage prodigy is certainly an excellent find for Pakistan and, if honed properly, a potential great in the making.  <br/>  <br/> Cricketing idol - Shane Warne <br/>  <br/> by <b>Cricbuzz Staff</b> <br/> <i>as of December 2017</i>",

      "bio": "Fakhar Zaman, born in Katlang, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa made his first-class debut for Karachi Blues in the year 2013. He moved to Karachi at the age of 16 and joined the navy. After a year long tryst, he switched his attention to cricket and has managed to sustain that since then. <br/>  <br/> A left-handed batsman and a handy part-time slow left-armer, his methods suit the limited overs format. He had a fantastic run in the 2016 edition of the Pakistan Cup where he scored 297 runs in five games including 2 fifties and a century. Thus, ended up as the second highest run-getter behind Ahmed Shehzad. His stroke-filled 115 in the finale helped his team - Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to win the title. <br/>  <br/> Strong performances in almost every format at the domestic level meant he has a permanent spot in the Lahore Qalandars side for the second edition of the PSL. His 'see the ball, hit the ball' approach makes him a crowd puller and a package that is hard to ignore in shorter formats of the game. His pyrotechnics earned him a spot in Pakistan's squad for the Champions Trophy in mid 2017. <br/>  <br/> He grabbed the opportunity with both hands by being the Man of the final courtesy a sparkling ton in the finale against arch rivals India. Pakistan became the latest team to win the Champions Trophy and 252 runs in 4 games made Fakhar Zaman a poster boy in the Pakistani cricket fraternity. He was sidelined for the 1st league game against India but then was handed a debut against South Africa in the second game. A quickfire 31 off 23 balls started his international dream and he never looked back post that. Fifties against Lanka and England and then the icing was the ton in the finals. <br/>  <br/> Due to his lack of consistency, he has been in and out of the side often, but when he gets going, he can destroy best of the bowling attacks single-handedly. In the shortest format he can be lethal and with more consistency he can achieve greater heights representing Pakistan.  <br/>  <br/> Fakhar was persisted with for the 2023 ODI WC but wasn't the first choice opener and Abdullah Shafique and Imam opened. However, given a chance late in the tournament, Fakhar lit up the tourney for Pakistan with back-to-back Man of the Match performances against Bangladesh and NZ. He was not favoured for the ODIs post that but was back in the squad for the 2025 CT.",

      "bio": "Someone who can trouble batters with pace and bounce, Haris Rauf has been one of the greatest finds for Pakistan in the recent past. Having played in various T20 leagues across the globe, Rauf has made a name for himself in a very short time. He made his international debut in the shortest format in January 2020, while he made his ODI debut a few months later in October 2020. In both the limited-over formats he has proven to be a wicket-taker for the Men in Green and his stats are a proof of it. His ability to bowl quick as well as deceive the batters with his slower ones is something which most of the players struggle against. His economy is sometimes on the higher side, but despite going for runs, Rauf has the knack of picking wickets even on the flattest of tracks in any conditions. He is just in his early career, but given his talent and potential, Rauf has a long career ahead of him.",

Naseem Shah is the latest in the list, having got his maiden Test call-up for the tour of Australia in late 2019, despite playing just five First-class matches. At just 16, he has already generated massive hype across Pakistan with his pace levels, discipline and ability to swing/seam the ball. Needless to say, Naseem is still raw even in First-class cricket, let alone Test cricket. Pakistan have taken a huge gamble with his selection, as Australia can be baptism by fire for rookie pacers. Naseem is blessed with all the attributes for being a potent pacer across formats but a lot of his future will depend on the kind of grooming he will get. He shot to fame while representing Pakistan U16 and also played for the U19 side. Naseem's fast-tracking has happened due to Misbah-ul-Haq who is now Pakistan's head coach as well as chief national selector. <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "A modern day fast bowler hailing from Punjab, who relies on variations rather than on raw pace, a breed rarely seen from Pakistan. A silky smooth action which helps him in his economical approach to the crease, Ali has graduated through age group cricket and his moment of fame came in Pakistan's limited over's leg in England 2016 where he played four ODIs and the only T20I after making his ODI debut against Ireland on the same tour.  <br/>  <br/> Hasan Ali, playing for Sialkot made his first-class debut against Lahore Ravi in 2013 and immediately caught eyes by picking up a wicket in his first over in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy. He continued to grow as a cricketer and the 17 wickets in 7 games at an average of 17.05 made him a force to reckon with and thus opened the doors for selection into the national team. He also made it to the play-offs of the 2016 Pakistan Super League playing for Peshawar Zalmi, which topped the points table after the qualifying stage under the leadership of the mercurial Shahid Afridi. In the 2017 PSL, Hasan Ali and his men went a few steps better to win the tournament.  <br/>  <br/> Hasan has had a dream 2017 as he picked up fifers at Sydney and Providence, Guyana against Australia and West Indies respectively. His rise has been welcoming for the Pakistani team who had been playing mostly with a troika of left-arm seamers.  <br/>  <br/> He was awarded the Man of the tournament award for scripting Pakistan's tremendous comeback in the 2017 Champions Trophy, which they won after being trounced in their first league game. Hasan starred with the ball and led the bowling charts picking up 13 wickets in 5 games. He started off on an unceremonious note in the first game against India but then picked up his performances to give Pakistan the silverware. Three wickets a piece against South Africa, Sri Lanka, England in the semis and India in the finale ensured Pakistan were amongst the wickets in the middle overs. His infectious energy and undying fighting spirit was praised immensely by the cricketing experts. Pakistan, thus, continues its tradition of producing world class fast bowlers! <br/>  <br/> by <b>Kumar Abhisekh Das</b>",

      "bio": "If grit and determination had a face, the sketch drawn will personify Azhar Ali. A water-tight technique backed by oodles of concentration at the wicket, Azhar Ali at number 3 is Pakistan's own answer to Rahul Dravid. Unfair, the comparison might be, but his batting acumen is based on wearing out the bowlers. This game plan suits him fine and he has creamed runs all over the world. The sense of calm he brings to the table was in sync with Misbah's captaincy at the turn of this decade.  <br/>  <br/> Azhar Ali became one of the few Pakistani players to make his Test debut before playing an ODI when he got his chance against Australia at Lord’s in July 2010. He played a crucial knock in his very second game where he made a match winning 51 at Leeds as Pakistan successfully chased down a tricky target of 180, with just 3 wickets in hand. With the knock, Azhar retained his place in the squad for the Tests against England the following month. He failed in the first 2 Tests, and despite the return of Mohammad Yousuf, retained his spot for the remaining part of the series. He justified the selection with an unbeaten 92 in the first innings of the third Test at The Oval, which Pakistan went on to win.  <br/>  <br/> His numbers away from home have always been a bone of contention but he has tried to set the record straight in the recent years. He had a torrid period in 2013 as he averaged tad under 20 in the 7 Tests that year to be dropped for the first two Tests against Sri Lanka in early 2014. But a majestic 103 off 137 balls scripted a famous win for Pakistan as they tracked down 302 in 57.3 overs to win a humdinger of a contest at Sharjah to level the 3-match Test series 1-1. Ever since, his averages have been above 50 in the succeeding years. A fighting hundred (139) against England at Birmingham in a lost cause in Aug 2016, a triple ton against West Indies in October, 2016, and a majestic double at the MCG in late 2016, again in a losing cause, have been vindications of Azhar Ali scoring runs all over the world. Year 2017 started off with a couple of hundreds in West Indies against the Caribbean team as well.  <br/>  <br/> His ODI numbers pale in comparison to his Test status as a solid number 3. He did get the captaincy in ODI's after Pakistan failed to make the knock-outs in the 2015 World Cup. Having been in wilderness in the ODI format for a good two years, he was strangely given the captaincy in the shorter format. He tried his hands at captaincy in 31 ODIs and after a 1-4 drubbing at the hands of the Aussies, away from home in early 2017, Azhar was asked to relinquish the job. Sarfraz Ahmed was handed over the charge and Ali also lost his place in the side for the ODIs against West Indies. But he was picked for the Champions Trophy and crucial fifties in the semis and finals against England and India respectively saw Pakistan lifting the Trophy. The way he counter-attacked the spinners in the finale put the Indians off their plans and paved way for a famous win for Pakistan. Post  Misbah and Younis Khan's retirement, Azhar Ali has decided to be torch bearer of Pakistan cricket and he has not disappointed yet. <br/>  <br/> by <b>Kumar Abhisekh Das</b> <br/> ",

      "bio": "There was insurmountable pressure when Imam-ul-Haq burst onto the scene during the U -19 Asia Cup in 2012. The pressure of being the nephew of Inzamam-ul-Haq was the first of many challenges he had to cope with in his maiden series. Imam, however, had put all that to bed and amassed an average of 45 from 5 games including three successive fifties and a 88 in his first game against India U -19. Guess what! He did all of that at the age of 16 whilst displaying glimpses of great skill and technique. <br/>  <br/> Known for his flamboyant stroke-play, Imam, unlike his uncle, is a left-hand middle-order batsman and represents Lahore in the domestic circuit. During the U - 19 World Cup in 2012, Imam failed to live up to the expectations, and could only muster a total of 78 runs from six games. Things, however, changed rapidly as he blazed 237 runs off six innings in the U - 19 Tri-series tournament in England in the same year. <br/>  <br/> Azhar Ali's injury before the start of ODI series against Sri Lanka, in October 2017, in the UAE enabled an opportunity for Imam to prove his potential. He debuted in the third ODI in Abu Dhabi and anchored a successful run-chase, cracking his maiden international ton while at it. A sharp ring fielder, Imam, is a sprightly character on the field. <br/>   <br/> <b>By Raju Peethala</b>",

But one look at his T20 numbers and you realize that this man loves the shortest format of the game. <br/>  <br/> He made his first-class debut for Faisalabad at the age of 19 in the year 2010. And so far has featured in more than 20 games being in and out of the side. Playing as a specialist batsman, his average of touch more than 17 does not do justice to his talent. And to make matters worse, a single fifty in almost 30 list-A games hasn't enhanced his reputation either. <br/>  <br/> But the way he announced his arrival on the T20 stage was theatrics personified. Playing for Faisalabad Wolves he smashed a ton off 59 balls against Multan Tigers which included 9 fours and 7 sixes. Asif before playing first-class had worked as a blacksmith but now happens to be a T20 star in the domestic circuit. His exploits were identified by Islamabad United and he was a part of the title triumph in the first edition of the PSL. Having scored only 34 runs in 3 innings, he would be hoping for a better bargain in the second edition of the tourney <br/>  <br/> <b>By Kumar Abhisekh Das</b>",

      "bio": "Iftikhar Ahmed born in Peshawar, Pakistan is a middle-order batsman and a more than handy offie. He has represented Pakistan in every format and was a part of the squad which drew the Test series 2-2 against England in England in 2016. However, it was rather an forgettable debut in a memorable game for Pakistan as they levelled the series in the final Test at Oval. <br/>  <br/> Prior to that he debuted in the T20Is and ODIs in 2016 and 2015 respectively. Again, failures in those handful of games meant that he was sidelined. But his strong performances at the domestic level have always kept him in reckoning of a national call-up. <br/>  <br/> He has been a part of Pakistan's limited-over setup and with his ability to hit big sixes, he can be a match-winner on a given day. He has played across varios T20 leagues and is considered to be a dangerous batter by many. His maiden international century came against Nepal during Asia Cup 2023 where Iftikhar smashed 109 runs off 71 balls. Pakistan won that particular game by a massive margin of 238 runs. Following that, the middle order batter has chipped in with handy contributions, but he needs to be more consistent in order to cement a place in Pakistan's squad.",

      "bio": "Twenty20 cricket seemingly picked Chris Gayle as its ambassador, for he scored the very first hundred in the format and now uncontestedly owns almost every record there is, including that of the most runs (now 10,000+), most hundreds, fastest hundred, and most fours and sixes. <br/>  <br/> Chris Gayle might stand tall at over six feet and wield his bat to make or break T20 leagues, but make no mistake about his affinity for Test cricket. His absenteeism from Tests later in his career may seem to suggest otherwise but Gayle has racked up 15 Test hundreds and over 7,000 runs across 103 matches so far, and frequently turns up for his many T20 franchises in jerseys numbered 333 - his highest First Class score, which he made against Sri Lanka at Galle, to become only the fourth batsman after Don Bradman, Brian Lara and Virender Sehwag with two Test triples in a lifetime. <br/>  <br/> Renowned as one of the most barbarous hitters of the cricket ball ever - he once swung a Brett Lee delivery past the Lord Tennyson school outside Oval! - Gayle dismissed footwork to a famous cricketing redundancy of his time, and along with other contemporary opening batsmen in Tillakaratne Dilshan, Virender Sehwag, and Brendon McCullum later, fashioned a batting era characterized by an unreal dependence on hand-eye coordination and breakneck run-scoring across formats. No wonder he became the first batsman to hit the first ball of a Test match for a six. And it's only fair that he beat Sehwag to become the fastest double centurion in ODIs, minting 215 off 147 in a World Cup game against Zimbabwe in Canberra, 2015. <br/>  <br/> Being the first cricketer with hundreds in all three formats, Gayle deservedly personifies the weight struggle between various cricket formats that stood intensified with the launch of IPL in 2008. So in 2009, Chris Gayle arrived in England after playing seven IPL games to captain West Indies in a Test match at Lord's, a game that his side lost heavily amidst scathing criticism from media and fans alike. <br/>  <br/> Be it because of his growing T20 appetite, his never-ending conflicts with the West Indies Cricket Board, or his degrading fitness level, Gayle's international appearances have gone from few and far in between to very little off late, with his focus now on being a T20 freelancer, not singularly in an era where retirement-age dangerously seems to hover around thirty-two. <br/>  <br/> Debuting for West Indies as a 20-year-old in the year 2000, Gayle went on to captain the national side, taking over from Ramnaresh Sarwan. He didn't start as an opening batsman, but soon graduated into one, but despite well-timed performances and a good record, doubts over Gayle's technique against seam and swing have remained. <br/>  <br/> Come to the more batsman-friendly limited-overs format, and Gayle seems more at home. To quell his effectiveness at the top, captains have often preferred to start with off-spin, his branded nemesis, as typified by Ravichandran Ashwin's hold over him. If not that, teams have religiously relied on short-pitched deliveries, aimed at his ribs, which Gayle either top-edges or more often buries deep into the square leg stands. His long reach helps him to get to the pitch of the change-up full deliveries which he nonchalantly carves back over the bowler's head. <br/>  <br/> Gayle's aversion to running ones and twos - more conspicuous later in his career - shouldn't startle you as much as his reliance on them, rotating the strike early in his innings before unleashing a theatrical, sometimes unstoppable barrage of king-sized sixes all around. His wonderfully limited agility makes for memorable catches, especially in the slip cordon where he stands from time to time, courtesy merit or convenience, or both. His handy off-spin and the ability to skid the new ball through once guaranteed an automatic selection into any team, including that of the prying T20 leagues around the world.  <br/>  <br/> Even as he belted records all over the place, Gayle'e mounting injury woes meant his stints with the West Indies national side have become rarer. He hasn't officially retired from Tests, he says his love for the longest form of the game hasn't ended, and fitness permitting, he would still love to add to his tally of 103 Tests. He's a man who leads by example. He's led his home franchise, Jamaica Tallawahs, to title triumphs in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) before shifting his allegiance to St. Kitts and Nevis Patriots - whom he took to the final in the fifth edition of the tournament. <br/>  <br/> Come to the Bangladesh Premier League, Gayle played for Rangpur Riders in the 2017-18 season and won the Player of the Series award for notching up the highest number of runs. Although he occasionally featured in T20Is for Windies, he wasn't a regular in the ODI setup. During Windies' tour of England in 2017, Gayle was recalled into the ODI side after a hiatus of more than 2.5 years. It was a start of a good run as he turned out in most games, helping Windies qualify to the 2019 World Cup and smashing England to all parts in the home series in early 2019. However, he lost form during the mega event which did not help the Caribbean side as they won only two games and finished ninth.  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL - Through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> Having lit up the 2007 World T20 with a stunning century in his first match, the big bucks were expected to flow in at the 2008 auction, and it was KKR, with a whopping 800,000 USD, giving him his first home. However, with West Indies generally touring during this period, and Gayle not quite hitting his groove, his biggest news-making headline in the first three seasons came when he extended his IPL stay to land at Lord's just a day before he was set to lead his side in a Test. But with middling form, both internationally and in the IPL in the past, he found no takers in the 2011 major auction, eventually needing an injury to Dirk Nannes for RCB to call him up as a replacement.   <br/>  <br/> What followed in the next three years was absolute carnage - announcing his arrival with a century, finishing 2011 with 608 runs and the orange cap, 2012 with 733 runs and the orange cap and notching up the highest ever T20 score of 175 in 2013 (which included a 31-ball century) against the Pune Warriors. Soon after, he started calling himself the 'Universe Boss'. Well, nobody could dare disagree. With age catching up, the reflexes slowing down and injuries pulling him back, the consistency began to fall, reaching such a stage in 2017 when he had to be dropped from the eleven. Although reluctantly, KXIP lapped him up in the 2018 auction for the base price, and though not the player of the old, he was a good enough version of himself, winning a couple of matches single-handedly and played a key role in Punjab's success in the first half of the tournament.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Pratyush Sinha</b>",

      "bio": "There are hardly any players in the modern era who have been celebrated in the way that Dwayne Bravo has been. Of course, the revolution of T20 cricket, the IPL in particular, played a major role in it but the West Indian's flair and personality have been peerless to be honest. A street-smart cricketer with both bat and ball, Bravo was also an astonishing fielder. All these meant that he was one of the best sought-after names in T20 Leagues. He was made for white-ball cricket due to his versatile skills. Bravo could bowl as a conventional seam bowler but particularly excelled in the slog overs of the innings where was priceless for his side.  <br/>  <br/> As a batsman, he was underrated but continued to chip in whenever needed although it was as a bowler and fielder that Bravo took rapid strides at his peak. His multi-dimensional skills gave him lucrative offers from T20 leagues which led to him preferring those to international cricket. The issues with the Windies board didn't help his cause either. Despite all this, he played white-ball cricket for the Caribbean side consistently till late 2014 when as captain, he initiated a pullout of the team, midway during their ODI tour of India. He was sacked as captain and also overlooked in the format ever since. His T20 fame meant that he did continue to play in the shortest format for the West Indies. <br/>  <br/> It was the IPL that established the brand of Bravo in the T20 format. After a moderate start in the tournament with Mumbai, the shift to Chennai did the trick for the all-rounder. He went on to become one of the main faces of the franchise along with skipper MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina. His persona matched the franchise's fan base and he was one of the vital cogs of Chennai's success. The fame saw him getting massive offers from the other leagues as well and he soon became a sensation in the format, often being among the most sought after names at the player auctions. Chennai's association with him got a new lease of life after the club retained him with the right-to-match-card at the 2018 auctions. This was after the franchise's two-year exile during which Bravo represented Gujarat. <br/>  <br/> While most of Bravo's stardom comes from his exploits in franchise leagues, his international performances were also quite valuable. He shone quite a few times in Tests, both with bat and ball, stamping his class as a genuine all-rounder. From his international debut in 2004 till 2008, he had a really good time in national colors but the T20 caravan derailed things thereafter. Constant pay disputes with the Board pushed him to pursue the cash-rich leagues which also gave him immense fame. Bravo quit from Tests in early 2015 although he had virtually exited the format much earlier, having not played the format since 2010.  <br/>  <br/> Bravo is a free-wheeling T20 cricketer these days and is relishing his favorite format. Despite a few injuries in late 2016 and early 2017, he has returned to peak fitness and as shown in the 2017-18 BBL season, he still has enough fuel in the tank, at least for T20s. Apart from his skills, the entertainment he provides through his antics makes him a total entertainer. There is no doubt that Bravo is still an indispensable name in the format and this could be true for the next few years as well. In early 2020, Bravo earned a surprise recall to the West Indies T20I side with it being a World Cup year and one more T20 World Cup scheduled in 2021. His powers have waned a bit since 2018-19 but he still has the experience which makes him an asset to have in T20s.  <br/>  <br/> <b>By Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "A destructive lower middle order batsman, Kieron Pollard is also an useful medium pacer with subtle changes of pace. He made his ODI debut in the 2007 World Cup against South Africa. He came of age in the Champions League tournament in 2009, when he decimated New South Wales with a 18-ball 54 when the game seemed dead and buried.  <br/>  <br/> That coming of age performance brought instant recognition and he was picked up by South Australia to play for them in the Big Bash. He was picked up by the Mumbai Indians in a silent tie-breaker for an undisclosed amount after the bidding process had reached the highest limit of $750,000. <br/>  <br/> He turned down a central contract from the West Indian board so that he could play T20s all over the world as a freelancer. Yet the West Indian board selected him for the ODIs and the T20s, giving him the permission to play in the IPL. Pollard had an ordinary 2011 and 2012 IPL and failed miserably with the bat. However, he came back with a bang the next year, scoring 420 runs and picking up 10 wickets from 18 matches as MI surged to the title in 2013. He was also the Man of the Final in 2013. <br/>  <br/> An aggressive batsman, with a penchant to clear the boundary with ease, he relies on hitting the ball out of the park. He is a little susceptible against spinners and often gets out to them unable to pick which way it is going. A dibbly-dobbly medium pacer, he often rolls his fingers over the ball and bowls his leg cutters on a consistent basis. As a fielder, Pollard is one of the best in the world and has taken some unbelievable catches. An all-round fielder who can field at any position, he uses his long reach to good effect. <br/>  <br/> It was only a matter of time before he hit his straps in the Indian T20 League. His uncanny knack of plundering biggies at will prompted Mumbai to retain him so far. <br/>  <br/> One of the most sought after players in the shortest form of the game, Pollard has also plied his trade for Somerset, Dhaka Gladiators and Barbados Tridents. <br/>  <br/> On the international stage he has shown the occasional flashes of brilliance like brutal second ODI ton (102) against a strong Aussie bowling attack at home in St Lucia. His maiden ODI hundred, which came against India was also a special effort, but Pollard failed to deliver the goods on a consistent basis. Having been branded as an ODI specialist, Pollard has been perpetually overlooked for Tests. Besides, injuries have reduced his workload as a bowler. He then missed the tour to New Zealand and the T20 Cup in Bangladesh because of fitness issues. <br/>  <br/> Kieron Pollard along with Dwayne Bravo did not feature in the West Indies 15-man squad for the 2015 World Cup. Their exclusion was widely slammed by critics and experts. Determined to get back in the West Indies team, Pollard responded, \"Despite the omission, I'm definitely not thinking that my international career is over. No way. I'm only 27 and I want to come back with a vengeance.\" <br/>  <br/> Pollard is often in and out of the national team but continues to be a great asset across various T20 leagues. <br/>  <br/>  by <b>Cricbuzz staff</b>",

      "bio": "Sunil Narine is one of those rare bowlers who has remained consistently economical in T20 cricket over the years, turning himself into a huge asset for any team that he is a part of. While his international career was hindered because of problems with his action, Narine continues to be highly effective in T20 leagues around the world. <br/>  <br/> Born in Trinidad, Narine made his first-class debut for Trinidad and Tobago in 2009 after taking all 10 wickets in a trial game. He was known more for his batting in youth cricket, but started making an impact with his mystery spin as he graduated to the higher level, especially in the T20 format.  <br/>  <br/> After a good showing in the Champions League in 2011, Narine got his maiden call-up for West Indies for the ODI tour of India. From there, he enjoyed a rapid rise and was signed by Kolkata Knight Riders for USD 700,000 in the IPL 2012 auction, a massive increase on his base price of USD 50,000. The deal turned out to be a huge success and started a long-standing association between the player and franchise as Narine played a starring role in their maiden title triumph, picking up 24 wickets in the season. Soon after the tournament, Narine made his Test debut against England at Edgbaston. And then later that year, he won the T20 World Cup with the West Indies. <br/>  <br/> However, before his career could prosper further at the international level, his bowling action came under the scanner. After being reported several times, Narine was suspended from bowling after his action was found to be illegal in late 2015. He made a return after making some adjustments but never had a prolonged stint as he kept getting into trouble. The last of his sporadic appearances for West Indies came in 2019. <br/>  <br/> While his international career petered out, Narine remained a force in various T20 leagues around the world. He had already added another dimension as a cricketer when he started opening the batting as a powerplay dasher in the late 2010s. His bowling lost some sting with his remodeled action, but what didn't suffer was his economy rate. His allround exploits were at the forefront of KKR's charge to the IPL title in 2024. He became only the second player to score 450-plus runs and take more than 15 wickets in the same season.",

      "bio": "A bonafide T20 legend who has won multiple trophies with various teams, Andre Russell is one of the most feared strikers of the cricket ball and also a bustling seam bowler who can touch high speeds. <br/>  <br/> Born in Jamaica, his introduction at the international level came in a format which he never played again after his debut. It was in the Galle Test against Sri Lanka in 2010 that he made his first appearance before being included in the squad for the 2011 World Cup in India. He picked up four wickets against England in just his second game of the World Cup while also scoring a brisk 49 in the run chase, although it wasn't enough to get West Indies over the line. A couple of months later, he smashed a blistering 92 not out against India in an ODI series at home, and picked up a four-fer later in the same series. He continued to make valuable contributions in the ODI format until 2015, after which he only appeared in a handful of ODIs due to injury issues. <br/>  <br/> It is in the T20 format though that Russell has had a major impact. He was part of both T20 World Cup wins in 2012 and 2016, won the IPL with KKR in 2014 and 2024, and has also lifted trophies in Australia, West Indies, Pakistan and Bangladesh. On a personal level, Russell has established himself as a brutal striker of the cricket ball and a fast bowler who has a wide range of skills. He has dominated different leagues in completely different conditions, right from the BBL to the IPL to the CPL. <br/>  <br/> Russell's journey has had its fair share of lows as well. He was banned from the game for one whole year in 2017 after being found guilty of a doping-code violation by an independent tribunal in Jamaica. His long-standing knee issues have also hampered him from time to time, most notably in the 2019 World Cup where he limped out of the tournament midway and had to undergo knee surgery. Apart from this, there have been disputes with the West Indies board over his availability and other things. <br/>  <br/> IPL through the years  <br/>   <br/> After shining as a power-hitter for the Caribbean unit, the IPL pundits decided to buy his services for the Jamboree in 2012. Delhi Daredevils were at the fore-front and they fetched him for a whopping sum of 450,000 USD. But sparse chances and injuries restricted his number of games to a handful for the 2012 and 2013 editions.  <br/>   <br/> Year 2014 was when fortunes turned around for the burly hitter as he was roped in by KKR. But even 2014 only saw him compete in a couple of games for the Kolkata side which won the tournament for the second time that year. But the tide changed for good in 2015 and it saw Andre Russell being Man of the Match thrice in that edition of the tourney. His three fifties that season saw him tally 326 runs at an astounding strike-rate of 192. He also starred with the ball and picked up 14 wickets to be adjudged as the MVP of the 2015 IPL.  <br/>   <br/> If his massive hitting wasn't eye-catching enough, the 2016 edition saw him winning two Man of the Match awards for his bowling. The runs were lesser but he did well to climb up the wicket-takers chart with 15 wickets in the season. KKR made it to the play-offs but failed to make it to the finale.  <br/>   <br/> After serving a one year ban, Russell was back in the IPL tirade and his exploits again and it took him only two games in the 2018 IPL to make a mark, again! A savage 36-ball 88 which included 11 sixes and 1 four served as a spectacle to all and sundry who viewed it at the Chepauk. KKR though ended up losing that game in the last over. But Dre Russ ended up with 13 wickets and more than 300 runs in the season.  <br/>   <br/> In IPL 2022, Andre Russell had another fantastic season as he played a pivotal all-round role for the Knight Riders. In 14 matches Dre Russ scored 335 runs and picked 17 wickets, and was clearly the top performer of the season for the Knights. Russell's best performance with the bat came against the Punjab Kings where he smashed a 31-ball 70*, while his best bowling spell of 4/5 came against the Gujarat Titans at the DY Patil Sports Academy. Despite Russell's prolific contribution in the tournament, KKR couldn't qualify for the playoffs as they finished 7th on the points table.",

      "bio": "Tall and lanky at 6' 7'', Jason Holder is a West-Indian all-rounder. Unlike many other West Indian all-rounders, Holder isn’t known for his express pace or powerful ball-striking. Instead, operating at just over medium-pace, Holder has made a name for himself as a wily seam and swing-bowler and as a  technically sound lower-middle order batter.  <br/>  <br/> Holder won the prestigious Lord Gavron Award in 2009, which is given to a Barbados Under-19 cricketer who's been outstanding on the playing field. A right-arm medium-fast bowler hailing from Barbados, Holder grew and learnt as a captain and player on the go, exhibiting an ever-improving temperament and progress in technical and tactical awareness.  <br/>  <br/> Holder was a part of the 2010 Under-19 World Cup squad in New Zealand and was West Indies' leading wicket-taker with 13 wickets. Later in 2012, he was a part of the West Indies ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour, replacing an injured Tino Best. However, he made his international debut only a year later in 2013 against Australia. His exploits in the ODIs and T20Is impressed Chennai Super Kings, who signed him during the 2013 auction for his base price of USD 20,000. The following year, he was thrown into the auction pool, where Hyderabad purchased him for USD 125,000. <br/>  <br/> Holder, whose USP is to hit the deck hard and extract extra bounce, then became a regular feature in the West Indian ODI attack. He made his Test debut against New Zealand in the third Test of the home series. Though he only managed to pick up two wickets, he contributed with the bat by scoring a fifty in a losing cause. He remained on the sidelines for the subsequent two-match series against Bangladesh. <br/>  <br/> When the players backed out of the India tour in 2014, citing trouble with payment issues, the board axed Dwayne Bravo from the skipper's role and handed it to Holder. His first real assignment came in the away series against South Africa, where his captaincy came under scanner for allowing the hosts to put up 439 in the second game at Wanderers. Nonetheless, West Indies chief selector Clive Lloyd felt that Holder was the best man to lead the Caribbean side during the 2015 World Cup and he continued to do so till 2020, thereby also leading the Windies in the 2019 Cricket World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Although Holder copped severe criticism for his captaincy, the selectors continued to give him the confidence which worked wonders when the Windies toured England in 2017. Chasing a record 322 runs at Leeds, the Caribbean side surprised themselves with a stunning victory riding on significant contributions from Shai Hope and Kraigg Brathwaite. During the post-match presentations, Hope admitted that Holder reminded him of the feeling of claiming a hundred and cited that as one of the main reasons behind his dogged determination. That win at Leeds was also Windies first Test win in England in 17 years. The Windies eventually lost the series 2-1, but not before giving England a run for their money. Holder, the bowler, excelled leaps and bounds in that series which can be termed as the zenith of his captaincy career. <br/>  <br/> In 2019, Holder scored an unbeaten 202 in the first Test against England at home and the Windies went on to win that game by a massive 381 runs - their greatest margin of victory in terms of runs on home soil. Later the same year, Holder claimed his 100th Test wicket in a Test against India. While he constantly went in and out of the limited-overs setup post his captaincy stint, Holder made it into Windies’ squad for the 2022 T20 World Cup on the back of some impressive performance, including a hat-trick against England at home earlier that year.  <br/>  <br/> Holder failed to be a consistent feature for any of the IPL teams he played for. Starting off with the Sunrisers in 2013, he featured in just 6 games that year and in just 1 the following year. He missed the 2015 season and was bought by the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2016. He failed to make a mark in the 4 games he played and it led to a 3-year absence. Coming back in 2020, he was bought by SRH again and this time he had decent returns - 14 wickets from 7 games. He was retained by the Sunrisers in 2021 and he did well again, picking up 16 wickets from 8 games. In the Mega-Auction of 2022, Holder saw his stocks rise sharply after he was picked up by the Lucknow Super Giants for INR 8.75 crore. Once again, his performances were decent - 14 wickets from 12 games. In 2023, he was bought by the Rajasthan Royals for INR 5.75 crore. ",

      "bio": "Not many realize that Shivnarine Chanderpaul has been around in international cricket since 1994 but such is the story of one of Caribbean's most talented yet unsung heroes. He is neither very attractive to watch (with his front on batting stance) nor entertainingly quick but over the years, Chanderpaul has grown to become the rock and holding force of a fragile batting line up. Chanderpaul's first Test century came in his 19th match, after scoring as many as 15 half centuries in the previous 18 matches. He spent most of the initial phase of his career under the shadows of the legendary Lara, and became a lone warrior after Lara's retirement. <br/> His batting stance has been described as being 'crab-like' and ugly to watch; however, one cannot deny that Chanderpaul has been the sole anchor of a depleting West Indian batting unit. <br/>  <br/> Although known for his doggedness, Chanderpaul has the record for the 4th fastest Test century. He smashed a ton in just 67 balls against the visiting Australians in 2002. He also starred in West Indies' record chase of 418 over Australia in Antigua, scoring 104 runs. He was named the captain of the team to face the visiting South Africans in 2005 and celebrated it by becoming only the second player to make a double century on debut as a Test captain, scoring an unbeaten 200 in Guyana. <br/>  <br/> But Chanderpaul's tenure as skipper didn't yield good results, for him and the team. He relinquished the job in 2006 to concentrate on his batting. The move certainly seemed to help him, as he enjoyed tremendous success in the seasons that followed. In the 2007 tour to England, he averaged close to 150 with the bat. This included unbeaten tons in the third and fourth Tests. Though the series was lost, Chanderpaul's stellar show reduced the margin of defeats considerably. <br/>  <br/> Though his game is more suited to Test cricket, Chanderpaul enjoyed good success in ODIs as well. He made significant contributions in West Indies' successful campaign at the ICC Champions trophy in 2004. Despite being a middle order batsman, Chanderpaul opened in the Champions trophy in 2006 and enjoyed good success, helping West Indies reach the final of that edition. <br/>  <br/> His good show continued in 2008, when he amassed 442 runs in 3 Tests against Australia at home. His performances were recognized and rewarded, when he won the Wisden Cricketer of the Year and ICC player of the year awards for the year 2008. <br/>  <br/> His strength in the years that have followed is his ability to adjust himself to any situation, thus making the best use of his ability.One of the best examples of his longevity is the 2012 series against Australia in which he ran up scores of 103*, 12, 94, 68 and 69, for an aggregate of 346 in five innings. The 103* in the first innings at Kensington Oval saw him replacing  Brian Lara as the highest run scorer ever at the ground. Also the scores of 68 and 69 at Roseau helped him becoming only the second West Indian after Brian Lara to score 10,000 Test runs.  Later in 2012, he opted to play for the shortest format of the game, representing Uva Next in the inaugural Sri Lanka Premier League. <br/>  <br/> In November 2013, Chanderpaul played his 150th Test against India at Mumbai which also coincided with Sachin Tendulkar's 200th Test match. He remains 7th on the list of players that have made the most appearances in Tests. <br/>  <br/> He also held fort for West Indies amidst tricky conditions in New Zealand, compiling 256 runs including a ton and a fifty. <br/>  <br/> <b>Interesting fact:</b> In 1999, Chanderpaul shot a policeman with a gun after he mistook him for a burglar. However, he was not charged due to the mistake. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Cricbuzz staff</b> <br/> <i>As of April 2014</i> <br/> ",

      "bio": "A prodigy, breaking school cricket records over the years, and turning up in his 20s as a blonde-haired big-hitter, Nicholas Pooran, today, has broken out as one of the many aggressive young West Indian batsmen coming up through the ranks.  <br/>  <br/> A left-handed stylish batsman, who can also double up as a wicket-keeper if necessary, Pooran's first major claim to fame was at the age of 16 the 2013 CPL, where he was signed up for Trinidad Red Steel - becoming the youngest ever player to play in the CPL - and lit up the stage in his first match with a stunning 54 off just 24 balls. He followed it up with equally impressive performances in the Champions League that followed. Representing the Windies under-19s in the U-19 World Cup of 2014, he emerged as one of the brightest talking points. finishing with 303 runs from six matches.  <br/>  <br/> However, just as his career showed signs of taking off to bigger things, he suffered a chronic ankle injury in a car accident which put him out of action for almost two years. He returned with a bang though - scoring 217 runs in the eight games - in the 2016 season of the CPL which led to an international cap against Pakistan later in the year. Trouble wasn't far though again, finding himself in a soup after opting to play in the Bangladesh Premier League over the domestic season, leading to a 10-month ban.  <br/>  <br/> A major turning point in his career came in the Canada Global T20 League in 2018 with CWI-B that put him back in the national reckoning.  <br/>  <br/> <i>Written by - </i><b>Vineet Anantharaman</b>",

      "bio": "Born in Berbice, Guyana, Hetmyer is an Under 19 World Cup winning captain for the West Indies. Inspired by his father Seon Hetmyer, Shimron picked up the bat at a tender age of 11. Since then, he never looked back. His initial apprenticeship started off at the Young Warriors Cricket Club, Berbice. <br/>  <br/> He represented West Indies at the Under-19 World Cup in 2014 as well but managed three single digit scores out of the five games that he played in that tourney. Even his first class debut was far from being memorable as he managed scores of 0 and 4 in both innings against Trinidad And Tobago. <br/>  <br/> However, destiny gave him a second chance and this time he was meant to marshal the troops in the under-19 World Cup and he responded with crucial fifties in the quarter-finals and semi-finals of the 2016 edition en-route to the silverware. <br/>  <br/> An attacking and destructive opener, he was picked up by the Guyana Amazon Warriors for the 2016 edition of the CPL. But he got out for a duck in the only game that he played. His promise and perseverance paid off and he was called up for national duties in April 2017 to feature in the three-match Test series against Pakistan. Slotted to bat at number 3, Shimron failed to convert his starts. He was later picked up for the tour to New Zealand in December 2017 but again, starts never materialized into anything substantial. <br/>  <br/> On the same tour, he was exposed to white ball cricket as well. In ODIs and T20Is, Hetmyer did not have a great time tallying only a handful of runs. He did however show a lot of promise as he scored a ton against UAE in the World Cup qualifiers to start his campaign. Hetmyer’s fearless and powerful strokeplay earned him a reputation as a middle-order enforcer and he continued to find a regular place in the Windies’ limited overs setup including for the 2019 Cricket World Cup and the 2021 World T20. He would, however, go on to miss the 2022 T20 World cup due to personal reasons.  <br/>  <br/> Hetmyer’s first foray into the IPL came in 2019 when he was bought by the Royal Challengers Bangalore but he had a lackluster season, prompting the franchise to release him. He was bought by the Delhi Capitals the following year but again, the promises proved to be larger than the performances. After two mediocre stints at Delhi, Hetymer was bought by the Rajasthan Royals for a sizeable INR 8.5 crore in 2022 and he delivered on his promise this time. Scoring 314 runs at a strike-rate of 153.92 in 15 games, Hetmyer was instrumental in Rajasthan’s run to the final that year. ",

      "bio": "Hailing from Barbados, Shai Diego Hope is a right-handed Windies batsman who made his Test debut against England in 2015. Having played just 14 first-class games prior to his international debut, Hope was selected for the national team after he scored a double century against the Windward Islands team on the last day of the Regional four-day competition. <br/>  <br/> After making his first-class debut in 2012/13, Hope caught the eye of the national selectors after a fantastic 2014/15 season. He was the fourth highest run-scorer of the tournament, amassing 628 runs in nine matches. <br/>  <br/> When words like talent and potential ring around, the world expects a proof of it; sooner rather than later. After averaging only 16 in his first 10 Test matches, Shai Hope had a point to prove. In swinging conditions, under lights and against a pink ball at Edgbaston, Hope was exposed to the harsh realities of the moving ball. All he could manage were scores of 15 and 4 in that Test where Windies infamously lost 19 wickets in a day in a meek surrender to concede a 1-0 lead. <br/>  <br/> Windies then roared back to pull off a stunning victory in only the next Test at Leeds. They chased 322 runs to win a Test match in England, beating them for the first time in 17 years, in 19 matches and after that abject three-day humiliation of Birmingham. It was Shai Hope who took Windies to a memorable victory with an unbeaten century, his second in the match. 'It has never happened before in the 127 year history of first-class cricket in Yorkshire at Headingley' -- were the words gushed out by Fazeer Mohammed on BBC Radio as Hope unleashed himself on the international stage whilst putting all the criticism to rest. <br/>  <br/> The most impressive feature of Shai Hope's twin hundreds was the calmness and maturity he displayed. With oodles of talent on his side and a good head on top of his shoulder, Hope could go a long way in achieving great success with Windies.",

      "bio": "Evin Lewis is an attacking left-handed opening batsmen and is one of the few players with two or more hundreds in Twenty20 Internationals. He made his debut in the 2016 World T20 game against Afghanistan in Nagpur, having been called in as a replacement for injured Lendl Simmons. He made his ODI debut later that year against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi. <br/>  <br/> Lewis smashed a 48-ball hundred against India in only his second T20I and went on to be the Man of the Match in Windies' narrow one-run win. His second T20I hundred was also against India, where he hit a scintillating 125* at Sabina Park. <br/>  <br/> Born in Trinidad, Lewis was a part of the Windies team that participated in the 2010 U19 World Cup in New Zealand. He went on to make his first-class debut for Trinidad and Tobago in March 2012 in the 2011–12 Regional Four-Day Competition. Lewis grabbed eyeballs as a young man at the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 in India, where he scored 211 runs across 5 innings to finish as the tournament's fifth-highest run-scorer. <br/>  <br/> He has plied his trade for many T20 franchises ever since. In Caribbean Premier League, he was with T&T Red Steel in 2014 and then went to St Kitts and Nevis Patriots in 2015. In the Bangladesh Premier League, Lewis has represented Barisal Bulls and now represents Dhaka Dynamites. For Windies, Lewis is now a regular opener, who either fills in for Gayle in latter's absence or bats alongside his idol. <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> A reputation for hitting big sixes in a format that worships power-striking, by the time the IPL 2018 auctions rolled around, Evin Lewis had the resume of a superstar. He had plied his trade successfully for many T20 franchises. He had smashed two T20I hundreds against India. And he was a destructive force at the top of the order for Windies, with or without Gayle. An IPL contract was never going to be too far, and so it proved when Mumbai Indians bagged him for INR 3.8 crores. <br/>  <br/> As expected, Lewis found his stride pretty quickly in the competition. After a duck in the very first game, the Trinidadian turned it around quickly to provide MI with quickfire starts in the next few games, the highlight being his maiden IPL fifty against RCB at the Chinnaswamy. Even a wrist injury in the middle of the tournament couldn't keep him off the boil for long. But despite Lewis's contributions, finishing as his team's third highest run-getter in the tournament, MI weren't able to make it into the play-offs. ",

      "bio": "A powerful ball-striker from Jamaica, Rovman Powell specialises in the limited-overs formats and has also made a name for himself with his leadership abilities. With extensive captaincy experience in domestic tournaments and T20 leagues, he earned the honour of being named the T20I captain for West Indies in 2023. <br/>  <br/> Raised in Kingston by his mother, Powell's career gained pace when he made his List-A debut at the start of 2015 and was named Man of the Match in his very first game. Just a little over a year later, he got the national call when he was selected for the ODI tri-series in Zimbabwe. Known for his big hitting, he played his first T20I against Pakistan at Bridgetown in 2017. Apart from his batting prowess, Powell also occasionally bowls medium-pace. <br/>  <br/> Powell played a key role in Jamaica's journey to the final in 2016-17 Regional Super50 competition and he was thereafter picked by Jamaica Tallawahs in the 6th round of the 2017 CPL player draft. He was then appointed the captain of Jamaica and went on to lead them to a Super50 title in 2022. It was a year where he enjoyed a purple patch, scoring his first T20I hundred which came against England at home, and backed that up with fifties in India and against Bangladesh in the following months. He also led the Tallawahs to a CPL title later in the same year. After leading the West Indies on occasion, Powell was appointed as the full-time T20I captain in 2023 with Nicholas Pooran stepping down. But while his stocks rose in the shortest format, his career never quite took off in ODI cricket due to poor performances. <br/>  <br/> Like a lot of his West Indian colleagues, Powell spends the majority of the year flying around the globe and plying his trade in various T20 leagues where he's found great success. Powell was initially bought by the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2018 but he didn't feature in a game. In 2022, the Delhi Capitals roped Powell in for INR 2.8 crores after a string of impressive performances across different T20 leagues. He got the opportunity to play every game for the franchise that year and had a decent season with some quickfire knocks in the middle order. But he couldn't replicate those performances for his new franchise - Rajasthan Royals - in 2024.",

      "bio": "The thing with talent is that it demands a cool head. Deprive it of that and it goes haywire, sometimes snowballing into almost nothing. Luckily for West Indies, Alzarri Joseph possesses a cool head. Not the kind that stymies a pacer's aggression, the kind which holds him in good stead even after success at an early age. Joseph shot to fame early. He led the side that won the Under-19 World Cup in 2016 and was also the quickest bowler of the competition. Tall, fast and blessed with an easy action, Joseph became the talk of the town.  <br/>  <br/> Like with most young promising cricketers, there were demands of drafting him early into the side. And those demands were met in 2016 when he was drafted into the Test squad against a visiting Indian side. A 19-year-old pacer announced his arrival to international cricket in style by dismissing Virat Kohli with a venomous delivery in just his third over. In the same year, Joseph made his ODI debut against another Asian side - Pakistan - in Sharjah. <br/>  <br/> Joseph sustained a stress fracture in his back in December 2017 during the tour of New Zealand and that forced the pacer to be out of international action for close to seven months. Post recovery, Joseph took part in the home series against Bangladesh and then represented St Kitts and Nevis Patriots in the Caribbean Premier League. Joseph was initially named in Windies’ squad for India tour, but was later replaced by Sherman Lewis as a Cricket West Indies (CWI) medical panel recommended that he should be allowed to continue his rehabilitation to full fitness for international competitions.  <br/>  <br/> The Antiguan started his career with the club that his father was once a part of. Soon after he got into the age group cricket and tasted success playing for Antigua. Joseph, who idolizes Dale Steyn, learned the craft under former West Indies pacer Winston Benjamin. CWI awarded Joseph a central contract across all formats for the 2018-19 season in October 2018.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Abhinand Raghavendran</b>",

      "bio": "Carlos Brathwaite is best known for hitting four consecutive sixes against Ben Stokes in the ICC World T20 2016 final at the Eden Gardens, thus leading his team to a famous win over England. Few months later, with only eight T20 Internationals under his belt, he was named West Indies' T20I captain. He replaced Darren Sammy, who was left out of the squad for the two-match series against India in Florida. <br/>  <br/> Born in Barbados, Brathwaite first came into the limelight in his debut first-class season in 2011. He had a fantastic debut match against Trinidad and Tobago as he took 7/90 in the second innings of the match. Brathwaite showed great consistency that season, snaffling 26 wickets in eight first-class games. He was rewarded for his performances with a place in the national team for the Bangladesh tour later that year.  <br/>  <br/> He made his international debut in Dhaka, in a T20I against Bangladesh on October 2011. In fact, his ODI debut came only a week later against the same opposition. He was left out of the national squad after that, though, with no substantial contribution in those two games and his next call came about three years later.  <br/>  <br/> A decent 2014-15 season earned him a place in the West Indies squad that travelled to South Africa in January 2015, but he couldn't make it to the World Cup squad that followed right after. Brathwaite was named in the West Indies' Test and ODI squads for the tour of Sri Lanka in October-November 2015. <br/>  <br/> His Test debut came against Australia in Melbourne later that year. A bowling all-rounder, Brathwaite registered bowling figures of 0/109 but then went on to score a gutsy 59 at No.8, following it up with a more fluent 69 off 71 balls in the rain-affected drawn Sydney Test. Brathwaite's form has dipped since his famous 10-ball 34 against England in Kolkata but he continues to be a big part of Windies' plans going ahead. <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> 'Remember the name' - chirped Ian Bishop on air after the heroics of the 2016 T20 World Cup final in Kolkata when Carlos Brathwaite stole victory and the World T20 title from Ben Stokes' and England's grasp. Since then, the Windies all-rounder has been hot property at the Indian Premier League (IPL), having already represented three franchises over a period of four seasons.  <br/>  <br/> Having been brought by the then Delhi Daredevils at 14 times his base price (from rupees 30 lakhs to 4.2 crores), Brathwaite didn't quite live up to the billing - despite decent opportunities with both bat and ball. After two tough seasons, he left for the greener pastures of Hyderabad. Coming into the squad at the back end of the tournament, Brathwaite scored at a good clip and was very effective with the ball - as his franchise made it to the final of the 2018 edition of the championships.  <br/>  <br/> Those performances came in handy for Brathwaite as Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) came calling with a whopping 5 crore bid - making him their third West Indian buy, after Sunil Narine and Andre Russell.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> ",

He was a shoo-in to the Under-19 level as he went on to represent Jamaica and then Windies in the 2014 U-19 World Cup. He only scored 59 runs in the event; however, he made his first-class debut against Trinidad and Tobago as the selectors placed their faith in him to come good.  <br/>  <br/> After a few good performances, his form deteriorated and he was in and out of the side, but he worked on his technical flaws to start churning out consistent performances for Jamaica and was eventually drafted in to the Caribbean Premier League in 2017. After a few good performances and a show of potential, he made his way into the Global T20 pool of players too, for its inaugural edition. He continues to be a vital cog in St. Kitts’ line-up as the franchise searches for an elusive win in the 2018 edition of the CPL. <br/>  <br/> <b>By Rishi Roy</b> <br/> <i>As of September 2018</i>",

      "bio": "Kumar Sangakkara, an elegant stroke player, a reliable keeper, an astute thinker, was the cornerstone of Sri Lankan cricket for close to 15 years. After playing close to 500 international games for his country, the all-time great cricketer played his final game in a Test against India at Colombo (PSS) in 2015. <br/>  <br/> Sangakkara's arrival on the cricket scene was sensational. A blistering 156 against Zimbabwe A in 2000 was enough to convince the selectors of his ability. Rewarded with a place in the one-day squad at the age of only 22, he won his first Man of the Match award in his second game. He scored his maiden Test century in his tenth Test after missing out twice before by getting out in the 90s. His batting was bordered by a temperament beyond his age. <br/>  <br/> Sangakkara reached the peak of his prowess under the leadership of his good mate Mahela Jayawardene, having a prolific run in both forms of the game. His compiled a monumental 287 in the company of Mahela as the duo put on 624, and sucked the life out of the South African bowling attack, while rewriting First-Class cricket record books. His counter-attacking century on a green pitch in Wellington in 2006-07 showed his class as a batsman.  <br/>  <br/> His memorable 192 in Hobart against Australia in 2007, yet again proved that he is the mainstay of the Sri Lankan batting line-up. Part of the modern generation of wicket keeper-batsmen, Sangakkara's versatility is the prime reason for his side's success. His top-notch displays are reflected in the fact that he topped the ICC test rankings towards the end of 2007, and was included in the ICC World ODI XI in 2005 and the World Test Team in 2006. <br/>  <br/> He is one of the few batsmen who owns the stupendous record of amassing 10,000-plus runs in both Tests and ODIs. He led the Hyderabad franchise for 3 years (2011- 2013), but had to pave way for Cameron White in the 2013. <br/>  <br/> Arguably,  Sangakkara was instrumental in helping Sri Lanka achieve balance in their playing eleven. Given the responsibility of leading the national side after the resignation of Mahela Jayawardene, Sangakarra had a pivotal role in giving direction to Sri Lankan cricket. <br/>   <br/> The advent of leadership catapulted his powers even further. Sangakkara enjoyed a great deal of success at the helm, leading Sri Lanka to wins in the tri-series in Bangladesh and defeating Asian-rivals, India. He also guided Sri Lanka to the 2011 World Cup final. However, he stepped down from captaincy, following the agonizing loss in the final, realising the importance of ushering in the new age of Sri Lankan cricket aside from sharpening his own batsmanship. The same year, he was adjudged the ICC ODI Cricketer of the Year. <br/>  <br/> He confirmed his place in the pantheon of greats when he became the joint-fastest to scale 10,000 Test runs alongside Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara. Second only to Sir Don Bradman in the list of double centuries, Sanga's monstrous appetite for runs grew with every passing game. In the company of  Jaywardene, he inspired Sri Lanka to be a force to reckon with, even in overseas conditions. In the holy quartet of Sri Lankan cricket, if Arjuna Ranatunga was the creator, Sanath Jayasurya the destroyer, then Sanga and Mahela will be fondly remembered as the protectors. <br/>  <br/> Embarking upon a new era, Sangakkara endorsed his succession into the creator's shoes when he was at the forefront of Sri Lanka's memorable World T20 win in Bangladesh in April 2014. In a tense final, his unbeaten fifty shepherded Sri Lanka to the title to break the 'final vodoo' as they tasted their first major World event triumph since 1996. Aptly, Sangakkara and Mahela, bade farewell to T20I cricket with that title. <br/>  <br/> During the England series in Nov-Dec 2014, Sangakkara completed 13,000 runs in ODIs, becoming the fourth player to achieve this feat. He scored four consecutive half-centuries followed by a century in the series. In December, he also became the second Sri Lankan to compile 20 centuries in that format. On December 16, 2014, he played his final ODI on home soil and scored 33. He amassed 2868 runs in 2014, the most runs aggregated when we consider all formats of the game in a calendar year. <br/>  <br/> On January 4, 2015, in a Test against New Zealand, Sangakkara scored his 11th double ton. Only Sir Don Bradman with 12 double tons is ahead of him in that regard. He also surpassed 12,000 runs in Test cricket. Two weeks later, Sangakkara became the third highest run-scorer in ODIs, surpassing Jayasuriya. He  also signed a two-year deal with Surrey at the start of 2015. <br/>  <br/> Sangakkara was in supreme form in the World Cup held in Australia. He amassed over 500 runs which included four centuries to his name. He became the first batsman to compose four tons in a single World Cup. After the World Cup, he hung up his spiked boots from ODIs. But continued to play in Tests until the series against against India in 2015. In his last Test at Colombo (PSS), he was given a guard of honour, when he walked out to bat by India's cricketers. <br/>  <br/> As much as he is stylish with the bat on the field, he is equally intelligent and effective off it. In an eloquent speech in 2011 at the MCC Spirit of Cricket Colin Cowdrey Lecture in Lord's, Sangakkara challenged Sri Lankan cricket's political establishment. He possesses a degree in law and is also known to be a voracious reader. Kumar Sangakkara is a complete person in the truest sense of the word. <br/>  <br/> Lesser known facts about Sangakkara: <br/> 1. Sangakkara became the youngest person to deliver the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey lecture at  Lord's. <br/> 2. Sangakkara  is the partner of Foundation of Goodness, a charity launched by former team-mate and close friend, Muttiah Muralitharan. <br/> 3. He represented Sri Lanka Schools in Tennis before switching to the gentleman's game. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Cricbuzz staff</b>",

      "bio": "Mahela Jayawardene, a masterful technician oozing class, has been the lynchpin of the Sri Lankan batting line-up for the last decade and more. He heralded a seamless transition to the new era of the Sri Lankan middle-order. Along with Kumaa Sangakarra, he ensured the absence of yesteryear greats, Aravinda de Silva and Arjuna Ranatunga was hardly felt. A prolific run-scorer, a shrewd thinker of the game and a sharp fielder, Jayawardene is one of the finest cricketers, the Island nation has produced. His achievements have been recognised by the international cricketing fraternity when in 2006, the ICC named him the Captain of the Year and the captain of the World ODI team of the year. In 2007, he was named one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year.  <br/>  <br/> Jayawardene made his debut in the historic 1997 Test match between India and Sri Lanka, in which the Lankans posted the highest-ever total in history of 952/6 declared. Being a part of this gargantuan effort perhaps multiplied his appetite for runs - he has scored six double hundreds including a triple, after scoring his first century in only his fourth Test on a wickedly turning Galle track against New Zealand.  <br/>  <br/> He has had his share of rough patches - being dropped from the side in 2003 due to lack of form in the ODIs, particularly in the 2003 World Cup. However, he rebounded strongly thanks to a good series against England, followed by a solid 2004.  <br/>  <br/> In 2006, the year in which he was made captain for both Tests and ODIs, he scored a majestic 374 against South Africa, the highest individual score in Tests for a Sri Lankan. His record-breaking effort came while being involved in a partnership of 624 with Kumara Sangakarra, the highest for any wicket in First-Class cricket, a landmark that stands undimmed by the passage of time.  <br/>  <br/> His greatest moment as a captain was the 2007 World Cup, where he led Sri Lanka to the final on the back of one century and four half-centuries. . In a somewhat surprising decision, Jayawardene relinquished the captaincy following a 4-1 ODI drubbing to India in February 2009.  <br/>  <br/> Jayawardene's batting is a thing of beauty and is a joy to watch. The princely drives and dexterous flicks continue to evoke awe and envy in generous measures. He became the first Sri Lankan batsman to tally 10,000 Test runs in addition to joining the slim, yet elite list of batsmen, who have compiled a ton in each format of the game. He has also amassed 10,000 plus runs in ODIs. Believe it or not, the fact is that Jayawardene is the only cricketer after Sachin Tendulkar to have made 600 international appearances. With his glorious batting hogging the limelight, Jayawardene's agile fielding and catching skills tend to slip under the radar. He has taken 413 catches across formats.  <br/>  <br/> With Sri Lankan cricket finding itself in dire straits, following the departure of Muttiah Muralitharan, Jayawardene took over the reins from Tillakaratne Dilshan in the 2011-12 season in the aftermath of losses in England, UAE, South Africa, with the most painful of all being the defeat at home against Australia <br/>  <br/> Jayawardene celebrated his return to captaincy with a typically silken 180, his 21st Test ton, which knocked England off the perch. He also led the Emerald Islanders to the World T20 2012 final at home. Just when one thought they would shed that eternal bridesmaids tag that had become an albatross around their necks, Sri Lanka again faltered at the final hurdle.  <br/>  <br/> Soon after, expressing his reluctance to carry on as captain, Jayawardene passed the baton over to heir apparent, Angelo Mathews. Notably, Jayawardene has a penchant for the big occasion. If any doubts resurface over the aforementioned point, look back at the 2007 World Cup semi- final, 2011 World Cup final and the 2014 Asia Cup final.  <br/>  <br/> In an era of freelance clubbers of the ball, Jayawardene proved that proper batsmanship could be equally effective, if not more, in T20 cricket. Having suffered heartbreaks in several finals of World events, Sri Lanka finally shrugged off their bridesmaids tag on a fairytale night in Mirpur in April 2014, beating India to claim their maiden World T20 title in 2014. It also turned out to be Jayawardene and Sangakkara's T20 swansong. Fittingly, the Sri Lankan ace signed off as the highest run-getter in T20Is.  <br/>  <br/> More than the plethora of records, the biggest contribution of Jayawardene has been the rich values he has showered on Sri Lankan cricket. He is a thorough gentleman to boot and is a perfect role-model for aspiring cricketers. He retired from Tests in August 2014, following the two-match home series against Pakistan. In January 2015, Jayawardene scored his 18th ODI ton against New Zealand, his first century on New Zealand soil in his 17-year limited overs career. He soon drew curtains on a much celebrated International career, retiring from ODIs as well with Sri Lanka crashing out of the 2015 World Cup quarters.  <br/>  <br/> But cricket refuses to leave the great man alone. Mahela now plays around the world in the budding T20 leagues and is a much revered voice in the commentary box with his analysis. Since his retirement he has also tried his hand at coaching stints like the one he did with the English team prior to the World T20 in India as their consultant. He took over from Ricky Ponting as the head coach of the Mumbai Indians franchise in the IPL for the 2017 season, leading them to title victories in 2017 and 2019.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Lesser known facts about Mahela: </b> <br/>  <br/> 1. Mahela had a younger brother Dishal, who passed away at the tender age of 16 because of a dangerous brain tumour.  <br/> 2. Mahela is a big fan of Tom Hanks with his favourite movie being Saving Private Ryan.  <br/> 3. Mahela is extremely fond of sea food.  <br/> 4. Joining hands with close friend and team-mate, Kumar Sangakkara, who is also a big foodie, Mahela launched a sea food restaurant called Ministry of Crab in the capital city of Colombo amidst much fanfare in September 2012.  <br/> 5. Mahela is married to Christina Mallika Sirisena, a travel consultant.  <br/>  <br/> By <b>Cricbuzz staff</b> <br/> <i>As of February 2017</i>",

      "bio": "Bleached hair, tattoos, pierced eyebrows and the flamboyance of a star, Lasith Malinga was truly Sri Lanka's pin-up boy. It helps when you have the skill set to back it up, and Malinga had it in plenty. That ball kiss before every delivery, that freaky sling as he bowled and the curl the ball took at 145ks has broken many a toe and has carved out a niche for itself in annals of world cricket. In a land where pitches were only a nicer term for rank turners and a giant in the form of Muttiah Muralitharan operated, Malinga prospered far beyond his shadow to shine in what ended up being Sri Lankan cricket's golden period in the late 2000s and early 2010s. <br/>  <br/> <b>Starting off</b> <br/>  <br/> Like the many kids growing up in Sri Lanka, Malinga started his cricket on the beach. An action as unique as his, where the ball is released almost parallel to the surface rather than the conventional perpendicular is bound to make you stand out. So the already locally-famous kid on the beaches of Galle with the tennis ball caught former Sri Lankan pacer, Champaka Ramanayake's attention. An out-of-the-box action demanded out-of-the-box training methods. Ramanayake would glue a pair of boots to the crease and Malinga would spend hours hitting them, hence perfecting his famed yorker.  <br/>  <br/> His raw talent wouldn't be hidden for long, creating ripples in the domestic circuit leading to him getting fast-tracked into national reckoning. He did start off with Tests, in Australia in 2004, where his skiddy pace saw him among the wickets, but his true calling came in the coloured outfits. With an armoury that boasted of variations by the dozen, nobody could've been surprised.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Soaring high</b> <br/>  <br/> First some facts. He's the only player in the history of the game to have taken four wickets off four consecutive deliveries in an ODI, a feat which made Sir Viv Richards gush and proclaim Malinga to be the 'best thing to have happened to Sri Lankan cricket after Aravinda de Silva.' With the likes of Jayawardene, Dilshan, Jayasuriya, Muralitharan and Sangakkara as well, Sri Lanka had truly become a global superpower in cricket and Malinga had a massive role to play.  <br/>  <br/> Given his bad history with injuries, which meant numerous surgeries and numerous comebacks, he was always the most potent threat in the ODI side. Despite losing pace and fizz in his bowling towards the latter stages of his career, he's ended up with four international hat-tricks, the only person after Wasim Akram to have as many, and 300 ODI wickets. Also, thanks to the multiple leagues he plays in, he is the second highest wicket-taker in all T20 cricket. <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL - through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> In 2008, riding high on the success of his double hat-trick blow and his yorker reputation, he was picked up by the Mumbai Indians for a whooping 350,000 dollars. This started a ten-year long association with the franchise, at the end of which his CV read - three IPL titles, two Champions Leagues and a purple cap. In a league where even the best of names where shunted around teams, he remained one rare example where his performances brought him retainers after retainers.  <br/>  <br/> The mutual loyalty complicates his equation SLC. His unwillingness to play for the local Lankan side in the Champions League was one such example. The tipping point however came in the 2011 season, when Malinga announced his retirement from Tests on being picked for a training camp that coincided with that year's season citing a 'knee injury', but continues to play in the IPL. But in neighbouring India, he was a star, an icon. <br/>  <br/> The association with Mumbai turned into that of a bowling mentor in the eleventh season, before the franchise were quick to realize that were going nowhere without the master's death bowling exhibition and soon lapped him back as a player in the 2019 season. And boy, he was a delight, saving his best for the finals to lift his side to their fourth crown. <br/>  <br/> <b>World T20 2014</b> <br/>  <br/> Bridesmaids through the 2000s and the 2010s when the ICC World events came along, Sri Lanka had made it to two World Cup finals and two World T20 finals since Malinga debuted, losing on all four occasions. The World T20 of 2014 started with a crisis in leadership. With a host of former skippers in the side, but all of them reluctant to lead, Malinga turned into an accidental leader towards the end of the league stages when the management decided to drop their original skipper, Dinesh Chandimal. <br/>  <br/> And boy, did he prosper. Bowling yorkers at the death at will to stifle the Indians, he ensured that the trophy finally came home - leading Sri Lanka to one of its finest moments on the cricketing field. It made him only the second captain of his country after Arjuna Ranatunga to lift an ICC World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Injuries</b> <br/>  <br/> Malinga's first tryst with injuries came in 2008 in the form of a knee injury, one that derailed his Test career. It meant sporadic appearances over the next couple of years, studded with weeks of rehab - from surgery to Ayurveda. It was followed by an ankle problem that flared up towards the end of his career. Post this surgery though, he was a diminished force, a pale shadow of himself.  <br/>  <br/> Acting in tandem with his earlier troubled knee, he merely ambled through the 2015 World Cup. The toll it took was such that he had to step down and withdraw from leading the side in the 2016 World T20 as Sri Lanka looked to defend their title.  <br/>  <br/> Just when it looked like his international career was almost done, something even he admitted to, barring an official announcement, he returned to the ODI fold for the 2018 Asia Cup - visibly fitter, thinner, quicker and a lot more accurate. Given the sheer dearth of resources and confidence Sri Lanka face leading up to the 2019 World Cup, Malinga's experience could just be the tonic they need.  <br/>  <br/> Nevertheless, once done, he can look back at his journey as one that transformed the entire notion of fast bowling in the world. <br/>  <br/> <b>World Cup through the years</b> <br/> Having become a household name for his unique action and his lethal yorkers by 2007, Malinga got the world to sit up and take further notice of his capabilities at the World Cup in the Caribbean. Finishing with 18 wickets in eight matches to end up as the fifth-highest wicket taker, he played a stellar role in taking Sri Lanka to the finals. His best moment came against South Africa, when they were cruising home with five runs to get and with five wickets remaining. He, however, produced a dream spell knocking out four wickets off four consecutive deliveries, making him the first bowler in history to pull off such a feat.  <br/>  <br/> By 2011 he was at the peak of his powers and would get on a roll as he cleaned up lower-order batsmen. Having been injured through the initial half of the tournament but made amends to his wickets&#39; tally as he picked up yet another hat-trick against Kenya on his way to a six-fer. In the semi-finals, he brought his experience to the fore, picking up wickets at regular intervals to break New Zealand&#39;s back and to keep them to a <br/> modest total. He ended the tournament as the second-highest wicket-taker for his side with 13 wickets. His performances mirrored that of Sri Lanka in 2015 - that of sporadic joy - as his pace dropped, hence lessening the impact of his disguised slower ones and made his yorkers easier to deal with. Although on the expensive side against some of the bigger teams, he still was the highest Lankan wicket-taker in the tournament with 12 wickets. Now, in 2019, fresh from trysts with captaincy, possible retirement and a stunning final over to seal the IPL title for Mumbai, he returns in the hope of his skill and experience carrying the struggling Sri Lankan hopes. <br/>  <br/> <i>Written by - </i><b>Vineet Anantharaman</b> <i>[June 2019]</i>",

      "bio": "Tillakaratne Dilshan has been a revelation over the past year or so, almost reinventing himself after making a comeback to the national squad in early 2009. A brilliant counter-attacker, Dilshan has the ability to cut loose once he gets set. He was the given the license to play his own game once he took on the role of an opener and has flourished ever since. He was keen on making the opening spot his own so that he could take over Jayasuriya's role once the left-hander retired. <br/>  <br/> Dilshan announced himself on the international scene with a blistering 163 in his first series in Zimbabwe in 1999. He was moved up and down the order and he failed to reach fifty in his next 8 tests before finding himself out of the team in 2001.  <br/>  <br/> Dilshan's revival was on display when he was recalled in 2003, scoring 356 runs in 3 tests against England and Australia. He went to become a regular member of the team, churning out consistent performances over the years. <br/>  <br/> Dilshan remained a bits-and-pieces players in the ODIs. An electric fielder at backward point, he chipped in with his off-breaks occasionally and did his bit with the bat, batting in the lower middle order. However, after a lean patch in 2008, he was axed from the team in September 2008. He returned  for the Tests against Bangladesh later in 2008 and after some stellar performances in that series, he sealed his spot in the ODIs convincing his captain to use him as an opener. <br/>  <br/> Dilshan carried on the good form to the Twenty20s as well. After batting at No.6 and No. 7 in IPL 2008, captain Virender Sehwag let him bat at No. 3 in IPL 2009.  Dilshan was phenomenal in the second season, unveiling his trademark Dilscoop (a shot played by kneeling down and scooping a good length ball over the keeper's head) and scoring over 400 runs in 13 innings. He continued in the same vein as he helped his team to the finals of ICC World Twenty20 in June 2009,  picking up the man of the series award for finishing as the leading-run scorer of the tournament. His 96 off 57 balls against WI won him the ICC Twenty20 International performance of the year 2009. <br/>  <br/> The rampaging opening batsman also set the 2011 World Cup ablaze with his impactful all-round displays. He cracked 500 runs in nine games at a brisk clip to carry Sri Lanka to the final, not to mention, he chipped in with 8 wickets with the ball as well. With Kumar Sangakkara stepping down as Sri Lanka captain, Tillakaratne Dilshan was thrust to the hot seat across all formats.  <br/>  <br/> Dilshan's leadership skills came under fire as Sri Lanka stumbled to losses in England, UAE, South Africa and even at home against Australia. By Dilshan's own admission, the extra responsibility adversely affected his batting. He quit captaincy after the dismal ODI series in South Africa. <br/>   <br/> Early in 2011, Dilshan was purchased by Indian T20 League high-flyers, Royal Challengers Bangalore for 650,000$. He was one half of an explosive opening pair with Chris Gayle. <br/>  <br/> Having resigned as Sri Lanka skipper, Dilshan was back to his run-scoring spree as illustrated by 1119 runs in 2012. During the same year, he scripted a career-best undefeated 160 against India at the Bellerive Oval in February 2012, albeit in a losing cause. <br/>  <br/> After featuring in 87 Tests, Dilshan retired from the longest format in October 2013. However, continues to be the driving force for Sri Lanka at the top of the order in coloured clothing. He has been one of Sri Lanka's most successful batsman. On December 16, 2014, on his 300th ODI appearance, Dilshan cracked his 18th one-day ton and also passed 9000 runs in the format of the game. He became the fifth Sri Lankan and overall the 15th player to achieve this feat. Sri Lanka went on to beat England in that game and he also took three crucial wickets in the match. Dilshan was declared the Man of the Series for his all-round performance.  <br/>  <br/> On January 23, 2015, Dilshan scored his 20th ODI ton and became the second highest century maker for Sri Lanka. He is also the 10th batsman overall to achieve this landmark. The dashing Sri Lankan opener announced his retirement from ODIs and T20Is during Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in August 2016. His DILSCOOP, however, remains as one of the best innovative shots in the history of the game. <br/>  <br/> </b>Trivia:</b> Dilshan was formerly known as Tuwan Mohammed Dilshan before he converted from Islam to Buddhism at an early age. He has a five year old son from his first marriage. He is now married to Sri Lankan actress Manjula Thilini. Meanwhile, Dilshan's brother, TM Sampath represents Ruhana, Tamil Union cricket and Badurelia sports club. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Cricbuzz staff</b>",

      "bio": "A very good allrounder, Angelo Mathews, made his international debut against Zimbabwe in November 2008. He is capable of batting anywhere in the middle-order and is a handy medium pace bowler. Such has been Mathews' impact, that he has become a regular member in all three formats of the game and has also captained the Sri Lankan side with composure. <br/>  <br/> Incredibly talented and intelligent, Mathews is good at adapting to different situations, despite his inexperience. He played for the Sri Lanka Under-19s when he was just 16 and captained the team in the 2006 Under-19 World Cup.  <br/>  <br/> He made his First-Class debut in 2007-08, but only made an impact in his second season, piling up 696 runs at 58 for Colts CC, which led to his inclusion in the Sri Lanka 'A' side. On the tour to South Africa, Mathews scored an unbeaten 99 with his team chasing 250. His coach, Chandika Hathurasingha, called it a mature innings and uses that innings as a good example for every player to learn from.  <br/>  <br/> In his short career so far, Mathews has put up some superb performances. The 51 against New Zealand in September 2008 helped Sri Lanka to beat the plucky Kiwis. He was involved in a match-winning 137-run stand with Thilan Samaraweera in that game. In the very next match, the marquee allrounder ran through the Indian middle-order as he picked up a career-best 6/19.  <br/>  <br/> There was no looking back as Mathews moved from strength-to-strength. His cool demeanour and strong tactical nous fetched him the Sri Lankan Test captaincy in February 2013. Having long been the heir apparent, Mathews took over the reins from Mahela Jayawardene after the latter expressed his reluctance to carry on following the Australian tour. <br/>  <br/> Mathews has certainly led from the front. He has pulled off several heists as a finisher in limited overs cricket with the stand out performance being his stellar 77 not out, spurring Sri Lanka to overhaul Australia's 239 from a catastrophic 107-8. His 132-run alliance with Lasith Malinga would rank amongst the game's greatest rearguard actions. He is one of the very few players, who has the ability to lend both ballast and fillip to an innings. Despite a few serious leg injuries, Mathews continues to bowl with verve and purpose. He usually operates in the middle overs, striving to squeeze the opposition with his nippy cutters although, he is no stranger towards shouldering the new ball.  <br/>  <br/> However, he was rendered ineffective in his Indian T20 League stints with Kolkata and the now-defunct Pune, before having no takers in the 2014 auction. Mathews had a terrific 2014. He led Sri Lanka to their fifth Asia Cup title in March 2014. He then hit consecutive centuries against England at Lord’s and Headingley to seal Sri Lanka’s first-ever Test series win in England. Under him, Sri Lanka also won the ODI series 3-2. The England tour was followed by a 2-0 win over Pakistan at home.  <br/>  <br/> Mathews scored his first ODI ton against India in November 2014, however, Sri Lanka were outdone by Virat Kohli's brilliance and lost the game. They subsequently went on to lose all five ODIs, one of their biggest losses in a bilateral series. Mathews came under lot of flak after Sri Lanka suffered massive defeats against New Zealand in the Test series in 2014-15 and they were not able to save the ODI series as well. <br/>  <br/> Mathews performance in the 2015 World Cup left a lot to be desired. He, however, scored the second fastest fifty by a Sri Lankan in ODIs against Scotland in their final Pool A fixture. His fifty came off just 20 balls. Mathew's captaincy was criticized after Sri Lanka tamely bowed against South Africa in the quarter-final. This defeat was Sri Lanka's first lost in World Cups after 2003, without reaching the semi-finals. <br/>  <br/> Mathews was bought by the Delhi Daredevils in the 2015 IPL auction for a sum of Rs. 7.5 crores. <br/>  <br/> The period after 2015 saw the retirement of the Sri Lankan greats in the form of Sangakkara and Jayawardene. And that put Mathews in charge of the immensely tough transition period. It started off with a loss at home against India. Things went from bad to worse during the tour to England where Sri Lanka suffered a massive losing streak and couldn't win a single game across formats. But Mathews turned it around brilliantly in the home series against Australia, the number one side in the world at that point, blanking them 3-0 in the Tests, hence leading Sri Lanka to their first ever whitewash against a major Test playing nation.  <br/>  <br/> His battle with injuries and bowling stress notwithstanding, he continues to remain one of the most revered all-rounders going around in the world today. It was validated by the contract he bagged in the 2017 IPL auction with Delhi Daredevils. <br/>  <br/> Lesser known facts about Mathews:  <br/> 1. Mathews married long-time girlfriend Heshani Silva in a Colombo church in July 2013  <br/> 2. In November 2010, Angelo Mathews was named ' Personality of the year' by living magazine in Sri Lanka  <br/>  <br/> <b>World Cup through the years</b> <br/> Although without a lot of standout performances, he&#39;d played a key role in Sri Lanka's 2011 campaign as a middle-order batsman and a backup seamer. He injured his quadriceps while fielding in the semi-finals, which ruled him out of the final, something that resulted in messing up the team composition. By 2015, he was the skipper of the side as well in what was a rather dismal campaign that ended with Sri Lanka being knocked out in the quarter-finals, the first time since 1999 that they didn't make it to the semis. Once again without a lot of chances to make a big impact, his standout innings was a 20-ball fifty - the fastest by a Sri Lankan in World Cups - against Scotland. Now recalled into the ODI setup on the back of a controversial sacking in the first place, and with Sri Lankan cricket in choppy waters, a huge responsibility lies on Mathews; shoulders to put his experience to good use in helping his made make the knockouts. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Cricbuzz staff</b> <br/> <i>As of February 2017</i>",

      "bio": "In a way, Rangana Herath has been Sri Lanka's Stuart MacGill - he has been a consistent performer over the years, but has been unlucky to be playing at the same time as Muttiah Muralitharan, getting few opportunities with little room for error.  <br/>  <br/> Herath made his debut in 1999 against Australia, but was back in the wilderness after three Tests, following a wicket-less Test against Pakistan in 2000 when they scored in excess of 600. Despite some strong performances at the First-Class level, the selectors refused to consider him for the next two years. He was then picked for the 'A' side for the tour of South Africa and Kenya in 2002. Some good performances on the tour followed by a couple of impressive domestic seasons earned him a recall for the home series against Australia in 2004.  <br/>  <br/> Herath only played one Test in that series and played the occasional Test match in 2005 before being ignored for the next three years. He was recalled again in 2008, playing a Test apiece against West Indies and Bangladesh, in which he failed to make a significant contribution.  <br/>  <br/> Herath was playing in the Staffordshire League in England to maintain his bowling form since the 'A' tours were few and far in between when the call-up for the Pakistan series came -- a turning point in his career. He had been outstanding in the domestic circuit as well, averaging 50 wickets a season for Moors CC.  <br/>  <br/> Herath revived his Test career as he picked up 15 wickets at 26.93 from three Tests, including two five-fors in the series. He continued his good form, picking up eight wickets in the next Test he played against New Zealand. <br/>  <br/> Herath attributed this remarkable turnaround to a change in attitude. As a youngster, he always played under pressure, trying to cement his place in the team, but of late, he has taken a more relaxed and confident approach, and that has helped him succeed.  <br/>  <br/> After being understudy to Muralitharan for close to a decade, Herath assumed the mantle of Sri Lanka's strike bowler post the talismanic spinner's retirement. Herath may lack Murali's aura, but he has held his own with subtle variations and dipping turn. In fact, Herath was the initial purveyor of the carrom ball which was later perfected by the likes of Ajantha Mendis, Sachitra Senanayake and Ravichandran Ashwin.  <br/>  <br/> Herath truly blossomed in 2011 when he conjured up nine wickets in Durban to spin Sri Lanka to a famous victory - their first Test win on South African shores.  <br/>  <br/> The left-arm spinner continued his fantastic form into the home series against England. He collected 20 wickets at an unbelievable average of 13.90 to terrorise the English batsmen. He, then, waged a lone war in Australia to save some face for Sri Lanka, who were blanked 3-0.  <br/>  <br/> Herath's purple-patch was in 2012, wherein he finished with 60 Test scalps, saw him pip his more illustrious compatriot and former skipper, Kumar Sangakkara, to be conferred with the Cricketer of the year honour in SLC awards 2013.  <br/>  <br/> A year later in 2014, Herath single-handedly spun Sri Lanka to the semi-final of the T20 Cup in Bangladesh with a mesmerising bowling spell, reading 3.3-2-3-5. With some classic flight and guile, he just toyed with the Kiwi batsmen.  <br/>  <br/> When Pakistan toured Sri Lanka in August 2014, Herath took nine wickets for 127 runs in the first innings of the second Test, the best figures for a left-arm bowler in Test cricket. He was the Man of the Match in both Tests and also won the Man of the Series. He did well in the England series, but was ruled out of the fifth ODI due to a hamstring strain. He missed the first Test against New Zealand as well. He returned back for the second Test and participated in the ODI series. <br/>  <br/> After regular captain Angelo Mathews pulled out of Zimbabwe tour in 2016 due to an injury and Dinesh Chandimal too made himself unavailable, Herath was handed over the captaincy of the Test side, making him the oldest ever Sri Lanka captain. Herath continued to lead the Test side in the absence of Mathews when he led the side against Bangladesh in the home series as well. In the same series against Bangladesh, he completed the feat of 1000 first class wickets. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Cricbuzz staff</b> <br/> ",

      "bio": "A draft straight from Sri Lanka's under-19s into the national side, Wanindu Hasaranga had a dream start to his international career when he claimed a hat-trick on ODI debut in June 2017 - making him only the third debutant and the first leg-spinner in history to do so. It was a sign of things to come as he would emerge as the go-to wicket-taking option in the limited overs formats, and in various T20 franchise leagues, over the years. <br/>  <br/> Hasaranga started off in the age divisions primarily as a leg-spinner, impressing in the 2016 Youth World Cup. His batting, though, soon came to the fore as he raked up impressive figures in the two seasons of the Premier League tournament for Colombo Cricket Club. The national selectors were further impressed as the form translated into List A success and he finished the 2016-17 season with the 'Most promising player' award. After his ODI debut, he carried his form into the 2018 season, emerging as the leading run-scorer for Colombo Cricket Club with 765 runs in nine matches in the Premier League tournament. <br/>  <br/> Having shown his credentials as an all-round package - which included his electric fielding abilities as well - Hasaranga started to get more and more opportunities at the highest level. While he missed the cut for the 2019 ODI World Cup, where he was named among the reserves, he made his T20I debut later in the same year. He would go on to find great success in the format, becoming the second-fastest bowler to reach 100 T20I wickets, accomplishing the feat in just 63 matches. One of the highlights of his career came on the biggest stage as he finished as the highest wicket-taker in the 2021 T20 World Cup in UAE. <br/>  <br/> With a deceptive googly and an attacking approach with his leg-spin, Hasaranga became a sought-after name on the T20 circuit. He enjoyed a big payday in the IPL when RCB bought him for a whopping INR 10.75 crores in the 2022 auction. The allrounder delivered the goods, picking up 26 wickets and having an economy rate of 7.54 that season. Although he couldn't replicate his success for RCB in the following year, he was sensational in LPL 2023 where he finished as the leading run-getter and leading wicket-taker to help B-Love Kandy lift the trophy. However, that success came at a big cost as he sustained a hamstring injury during the tournament which ruled him out of the ODI World Cup in India a couple of months later. <br/>  <br/> Even as Hasaranga's stocks grew in the limited overs formats as he was named captain of the T20I squad in late 2023, he wasn't the same force in red-ball cricket, playing just four Tests for Sri Lanka before announcing his retirement from Test cricket in 2023 at the age of 26.",

      "bio": "A hard-hitting all-rounder, who juggles between being a lower order impetus and a handy medium pacer who can swing the ball, Dasun Shanaka is yet another product to come out of the fertile Sinhalese Sports Club. After a few years of steady performances in the shorter formats, his first big claim to fame were two whirlwind centuries in club cricket in 2015.  <br/>  <br/> Although he'd made his T20I debut before that against Pakistan, these knocks sprung him into the limelight - something he grabbed with a three-fer against India on  green Pune wicket in 2016. A Test debut followed soon on the tour to England, but it was his ODI debut against Ireland that really stood out, where he became only the third Sri Lankan to pick a fifer on debut. He was further named the Man of the Series.  <br/>  <br/> However, inconsistencies because of how low he bats and the limited opportunities at that position, he couldn't cement his spot in either format and remained in and out over the next three years. <br/>  <br/> In 2017, things got worse. During a Test match against India at Nagpur, the match referee found him guilty of ball tampering and fined him 75 percent of his match fees.  <br/>  <br/> He made a strong comeback the following year, smashing a 34-ball 65 in an ODI against South Africa, a knock that included four fours and five sixes. He was further named as the skipper of the T20I leg on the tour to Pakistan when most of the senior players backed out citing security worries. He made a bit of history on that tour, winning 3-0 with a weakened side against the then number one side in their own backyard.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> <b>Vineet Anantharaman</b>",

      "bio": "Born on April 3, 1989, Thisara Perera is amongst the new generation of attacking allrounders from Sri Lanka. Perera began his career as a bowler, opening for the Under-19 team. He impressed with useful performances in a tri-nation tournament in July 2007 and the subsequent youth Test against India. These performances helped him gain an entry into the Under-19 squad for the World Cup in Malaysia in 2008.  <br/>  <br/> Perera received his maiden call-up into the national squad as an emergency replacement for Angelo Mathews during Sri Lanka's tour of India in late 2009. In just his third match, he starred with both bat and ball to help Sri Lanka edge past India in Mirpur in Bangladesh.  <br/>  <br/> Perera seemed to have reserved his best against India. He picked up his maiden five-wicket haul against the northern neighbours in Dambulla in 2010 and followed it up with another five-wicket haul in the successful conquest of Australia, later that year.  <br/>  <br/> His success at the ODI level helped Perera cement his place in the team and got a maiden call-up for the Test tour to England. He made his debut in Cardiff but had to wait until the third Test to pick up his first victim in the form of Kevin Pietersen.  <br/>  <br/> His attacking batting and more then useful bowling caught the attention of Chennai Super Kings in the 2010 auctions before subsequently moving onto Kochi Tuskers Kerala and Mumbai Indians. He was later snapped by Hyderabad for USD 675,000 at the 2013 auction in Chennai, following some heavy bidding. He claimed 19 wickets from 16 matches for SRH in the Indian T20 League 2013. He was purchased by Kings XI Punjab for 16 million in 2014 but was unable to play that season. <br/>  <br/> Another alumnus of the prestigious St. Joseph college in Colombo, Thisara's all-round success comes as no surprise. A game-changer in the truest sense of the world, the 25-year- old has helped Sri Lanka mastermind a slew of come-from-behind victories. His lusty blows came to the fore during his 44-ball-69 against South Africa in Kimberley as the Emerald Islanders chased down their first 300 plus target against the Proteas. He was also on song in the 2012 home series against Pakistan, leading the bowling charts with 11 victims, including a hat-trick. The season also witnessed Thisara improve his credentials as a 'finisher'. Add his acrobatic fielding to the mix, you obtain a potent package. Sri Lankan coach, Graham Ford, who was mighty impressed with Thisara, remarked that the latter's approach often draws parallels with Lance Klusener.  <br/>  <br/> Another significant match-winning act hauled in when Perera lifted his side to 180 from 67-8 to fashion a narrow victory thanks to a typically counter-punching and unconquered 80 against Bangladesh in February 2014.  <br/>  <br/> Enjoying a promotion, ahead of the more experienced Angelo Mathews, he alongside Kumar Sangakkara applied the finishing touches to Sri Lanka's fairytale T20 Cup title win two months later.  <br/>  <br/> Punjab then roped in his wares for the seventh edition of the Indian T20 League. In stark contrast to his ODI career, his Test career is yet to take off even though he has displayed occasional flashes of brilliance like his 75 versus Pakistan in Pallekele.  <br/>  <br/> Thisara was brilliant in the ODI series against England in May 2014. He performed well both in the T20Is and ODIs. He continued his good form against Pakistan as well. In the second ODI, he scored a rapid 65 and picked up three wickets to set-up a Sri Lankan win. He picked up four  wickets in the final ODI. His all-round performance, which earned him the Man of the Series award, helped Sri Lanka seal a series victory.  <br/>  <br/> Perera had a lukewarm 2015 World Cup campaign. He managed to pick up only 6 wickets in the tournament and was ineffective with the bat. Despite having a unwanted reputation of being consistently inconsistent, Thisara manages to find a spot in T20 leagues all around which was validated by him being picked up for the newly inducted franchise in the 2016 season of the IPL, Rising Pune SuperGiants. He also played a crucial role as a replacement for Dwayne Bravo in the Big Bash League for the Melbourne Renegades later in the season. <br/>  <br/> <b>World Cup through the years</b> <br/> It wasn't until the finals of 2011 that he came up with something significant with the bat - having contributions of 6, 11, 8 and 3 until that point, before a nine-ball cameo of 22* in <br/> the final helped Sri Lanka post a strong-looking 274 on the board. It was with the ball that he was effective, picking up nine wickets in those four matches. But that wasn't enough for him to hold onto his spot, getting dropped before returning as a replacement for the injured Angelo Mathews. In 2015, having gained the experience of being a <br/> globetrotting T20 superstar, his World Cup campaign was a disappointment. Apart from one decent innings of 47 against Afghanistan, he managed only single digits in the other opportunities he got with the bat. His performance with the ball was just as underwhelming, picking up six wickets in six matches at a pretty unhealthy economy too. Now coming on the back of some stunning performances against the Kiwis and the small English grounds and the flat wickets suiting his style of play, 2019 could just be Perera's year. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Updated February 2017, Cricbuzz staff</b>",

      "bio": "Fearless, audacious and turbo-aggressive, Kusal Janith Perera is a firecracker in the Sri Lankan batting unit. Sanath Jayasuriya's career experienced a U-turn when he was elevated to the top of the order, launching flying starts. Kusal, who also began as a middle-order batsman, seems to have taken a leaf out of his predecessor's book. <br/>  <br/> Perera was a regular in the Sri Lankan Under-19 teams since 2007. He, then, debuted for the Colts Cricket Club in 2009. The dashing young batsman etched his name in the Sri Lankan cricket folklore when he slammed 336 from just 275 deliveries for the Colts against Saracens at Havelock Park, Colombo. The hurricane knock, featuring 14 maximums and 29 hits to the fence, is the only triple century in the history of the domestic competition. <br/>  <br/> His short-arm jabs, pick-up hits and square cuts provoked inevitable comparisons with Jayasuriya. Much like Jayasuriya, Kusal is known to have a penchant for big runs. He carried on, scoring prolifically at the domestic circuit to bang hard on the national selectors' doors. Kusal is a handy wicket-keeper as well. <br/>  <br/> An injury to Kumar Sangakkara paved way for Perera's ODI debut in Jaunuary 2013 in Adelaide. He batted at Number 4, scoring an unbeaten 14 in a charming little cameo, seeing Sri Lanka past the finish line along with centurion, Thirimanne. <br/>  <br/> Identifying the spirit of adventure in his batsmanship, the Sri Lankan think-tank bumped him up to the top of the order in the short T20I series that followed the ODIs. Needless to say, the southpaw's pyrotechnics gave the Emerald Islanders the edge. <br/>  <br/> More success was to follow, this time in the Indian subcontinent, where Rajasthan Royals netted his services for 2013 Indian T20 League, although he was relegated to the sidelines for the bulk of the tourney. <br/>  <br/> Joining hands with Tillakaratne Dilshan, Perera has provided brief glimpses of tearing open the portal to the 1996 Jayasuriya-Kaluwitharana era. Having enjoyed a successful 2014-15 season in ODIs, Perera earned his maiden call-up for Tests in July-August 2015 against india. He compiled half-centuries in both innings on his debut and became only the second Sri Lankan to do so. <br/>  <br/> Tragedy struck late in 2015 with a failed dope test, where his urine sample tested positive for a banned substance - forcing the SLC to pull him out of all future tours. His future looked in dismay when he tested positive for a performance enhancing drug, 19-Norandrostenedione in both his 'A' and 'B' samples. However with his board backing him to the hilt, he underwent ploygraphic tests to prove his innocence and came out with success. Not before losing nearly seven months of cricket. <br/>  <br/> His performances on his comeback remain just as erratic and inconsistent, but it is the potential he threatens to unleash that keeps him in the side on most occasions in all formats. Not for no reason does he boast of the record for the highest strike rate of 272 in an innings of over 50 runs - one where he overtook his lookalike and idol, Sanath Jayasuriya. <br/>  <br/> Not part of the initial 2015 World Cup squad, he was a late draft in for the injured Dimuth Karunaratne midway through the tournament. With opportunities in only a couple of matches - a quickfire 24 in the first batting in the middle-order and a failure opening in the innings in the second - he just didn't have the time to leave an impact as Sri Lanka crashed out in the quarter-finals. Now, with perhaps the best Test innings by a Sri Lankan batsman behind him earlier in the season, he comes into the 2023 World Cup with a senior batsman on whom the rather inexperienced side is going to rely heavily for good starts.",

      "bio": "One of those abundant batsman-keeper combos, Kusal Mendis is a promising prospect for Sri Lanka in the post Sangakkara-Jayawardene era. He shot to prominence with his Schoolboy of the Year award in 2013 and in the following season, the national selectors awarded the captaincy of the under-19s for the 2014 World Cup. His Test cap followed soon after in the home series against the West Indies.  <br/>  <br/> He stamped his presence in the international scene with a stunning century against Australia at Pallekele making him the youngest to do so. It was a single handed knock to rescue Sri Lanka from the doldrums after having conceded a first-innings lead to get them back into the contest and eventually pave the way towards a clean sweep.  <br/>  <br/> The tri-series in Zimbabwe saw him notch up impressive performances with the bat in the coloured clothing format as well. With two half-centuries helping his side bag the title, he was adjudged the Man of the Series as well. He translated the form into the whites against Bangladesh at home with a stunning 194 and followed it up in the ODIs to come with a maiden ton.  <br/>  <br/> Having invested heavily in the youngster, Sri Lanka have already started reaping some dividends. Just 22, Mendis' ability goes beyond his years. A naturally aggressive batsman, Mendis has a pleasing range of strokes and the maturity to go with it. He was a shining light in an otherwise damp Sri Lankan performance in the 2017 edition of the Champions Trophy. Back home, he got starts against Zimbabwe, but failed to convert them into something substantial.  <br/>  <br/> However, Mendis proved his class in the Test series against India, belting a stunning hundred in the second Test against India - which further enhanced his class and adaptability as a batsman. Sri Lanka are a team in transition and they need players like Mendis to step up if they are to get back to the golden era.",

      "bio": "A compact opening batsman, Dimuth Karunaratne is emerging as the cream of the young crop. The southpaw's first tryst with fame arrived when he cracked 131 against St. Peter's college to become the highest individual scorer for the Josephians, going past the previous best of 114 not out held by Fred Perera since 1934. Angelo Mathews and Thisara Perera also featured in that match. <br/>  <br/> Notably, Karunaratne attended the famous St. Joseph's college in Colombo which has supplied many top Sri Lankan cricketers, including Chaminda Vaas. Karunaratne let his bat do the talking in the domestic circuit and steadily progressed through the Under -19 level. Impressed with the young batsman, the selectors picked him for the series against England and Scotland. Having registered scores of 4 and 60, he showcased glimpses of his flourishing potential. <br/>  <br/> Karunaratne also found himself in Sri Lanka's Test squad for the tour of South Africa at the close of 2011, although he did not make the playing XI in any of those encounters. He was a regular traveller until the much-awaited Test debut materialised in 2013 when he was given the nod to partner Tharanga Paranavitana, coming in for the injured Tillakaratne Dilshan, against New Zealand in Galle. Beset with nervousness, Karunaratne fell for a duck in his first Test innings. However, he pulled his socks up and made a fluent, run-a-ball 60 in the second essay as Sri Lanka surged to a thumping 10-wicket win. <br/>  <br/> Karunaratne's maiden Test century came against New Zealand at the Hagley Oval on December 28, 2014, where he scored a gritty 152 off 363 balls in the second match. The 2015 World Cup that followed wasn't a pleasant experience, where a hand fracture cut short a promising start. His focus majorly since then has been in Tests. <br/>  <br/> He stamped his authority at the top of the order ever since, first with a century against Pakistan and soon followed it up with a mammoth 186 against the touring West Indies. Despite a minor blip against Australia in Sri Lanka's historic 3-0 sweep, where Karunaratne got five single-digit scores in six innings, with Mitchell Starc having turned him into his bunny, he came back hard against Zimbabwe, grabbing the Man of the Series. <br/>  <br/> He took his form into the UAE, Pakistan's fortress. In Sri Lanka's first ever Day-Night Test, he notched up his career-best score of 196, thus becoming the first Sri Lankan to get to the landmarks of 50, 100 and 150 in a D/N Test. He played a stellar role in routing Pakistan and breaching their long unbeaten series record in the Middle-East. It thus comes as no surprise that he ended 2017 as one of the highest run-getters in the year. <br/>  <br/> Karunaratne hasn't been in great form in recent times, hence it will be interesting to see if he gets to feature in the playing XI for Sri Lanka.",

      "bio": "Over the past decade or so, Sri Lanka have had a few exciting fast bowlers coming up through the ranks with the ability to bowl at high speeds albeit with the inevitable flaw of being injury prone. Dushmantha Chameera falls into that category - a nice flowing run up coupled with a simplified action that enables him to generate high speeds. He is also a rather skiddy customer despite his height and has the ability to rush batsmen off the surface.  <br/>  <br/> Chameera broke into the Sri Lankan domestic scene during the year 2012 and started to impress almost instantly. He was highly talked about and a national call up duly arrived in 2015 across all three formats. However, injuries have hampered him a lot, affecting his Test career in particular. At a point, Chameera was touted as the fastest bowler in the country and given his talent, it will be tragic if he doesn't fulfill his potential but for that, staying fit is the biggest hurdle. <br/>  <br/> The IPL has had quite a few Lankans participating in it since its inception including some of their biggest names of all times. Chameera became the latest to join the League when he got snapped up by the Rajasthan Royals at the 2018 auctions. If injuries don't hamper him, he can provide some firepower to the RR bowling attack. The same goes for his international career because Sri Lanka are in desperate need for someone to spearhead their pace bowling resources. <br/>  <br/> <b>By Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

In fact, he made his debuts across the formats in 2021 and it was against the West Indies where he announced his arrival at the international arena in style. His initial days in ODIs weren't great as he failed to put up substantial scores and was dismissed for single digits on quite a few occasions, but after his knock of 75 against Zimbabwe at Galle, Nissanka improved drastically in the 50-over format. The stylish opener scored his maiden ODI century against Australia in 2022 where he was adjudged the man of the match, while he also notched up back-to-back centuries in the ICC World Cup Qualifiers in 2023. He scored centuries against Zimbabwe and West Indies - the two teams who failed to qualify for the World Cup. Given his ability to score big, Sri Lanka would want Nissanka to click in the World Cup in India. Being accustomed to the sub continent conditions, Nissanka is one of the players to watch out for.",

He made his ODI debut against South Africa in 2021 and picked 4 wickets in the match. It was a fantastic ODI debut for the mystery spinner as Sri Lanka won by 78 runs. In the Qualifiers for World Cup 2023, Theekshana played a crucial role as the spinner claimed 21 wickets and he was one of the reasons for Sri Lanka's success in the tournament. Apart from ODIs, Theekshana also has an impressive record in the T20 format. He bowls in the powerplay and often has the ability to bowl crucial spells. If Sri Lanka are to challenge teams and come out on top in World Cup 2023, Theekshana needs to play a pivotal role in doing so. He has the experience of playing in Indian conditions being a part of Chennai Super Kings, hence it will be interesting to see his performance in the tournament.",

      "bio": "A bowler with a slingy action, Matheesha Pathirana made his international debut for Sri Lanka in August 2022 during the Asia Cup against Afghanistan. It wasn't a debut to remember though as Sri Lanka were beaten by Afghanistan in that game by 8 wickets. Pathirana conceded 16 runs in the only over he bowled in the 20-20 contest. His ODI debut came against the same oppositon 10 months later, and once again Pathirana couldn't chip in with a substantial contribution as he managed to pick only 1 wicket in the 50-50 over contest. Sri Lanka ended on the losing side once again as Afghanistan won the match by 6 wickets. Pathirana's start to his international career wouldn't be a pleasant one, however, the pace bowler had an impressive season for the Chennai Super Kings in IPL 2023 where he picked 10 wickets in the tournament and played a pivotal role in CSK's successful campaign. As a result of Pathirana's crucial spells, CSK managed to win a few games. An impactful bowler in the shortest bowler, but it will be interesting to see if he manages to be equally impactful in the ODI format.",

      "bio": "A reference from the government does go a long way in getting things done in Sri Lanka. Not with Bhanuka Rajapaksa, who despite being a relative of the former Sri Lankan President, Mahinda Rajapakse, had to wait for ten long years before breaking into the national side.  <br/>  <br/> A hard hitting left-handed middle-order batsman, Bhanuka made waves as early as 2010, when he emerged as the leading run-getter in the under-19 World Cup. He followed it up with the 'Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year' award and the 'Young emerging U-19 Player' in the following year.  <br/>  <br/> Having modeled his game around Australia's Adam Gilchrist, Bhanuka has been a consistent performer in Sri Lanka's domestic circuit over the years. It was in the U19 World Cup in 2010 that he first showcased his range of shots, ending up as Sri Lanka's highest run-scorer in the tournament. Bhanuka's style of play doesn't guarantee consistency, especially in the longer format but his gameplay is well-suited for limited-overs cricket. For someone who made his domestic debut in 2009, he had to wait 10 years before representing Sri Lanka. His international debut came in the away tour of Pakistan, where many senior Sri Lanka players refused to travel citing security issues.  where he impressed one and all with his dynamic strokeplay. Rajapaksa played a Man of the Match innings in the second T20I in that series, scoring 77 off just 48 balls.  <br/>  <br/> However, he failed to make the cut for the Sri Lanka squad for the 2019 World Cup, and was then dropped from the team that toured England and West Indies in 2021 in controversial fashion. Bhanuka was deemed to be unfit and then Head Coach Micky Arthur dubbed him a comfort zone cricketer since Rajapaksa failed to comply with the skin fold tests to certify fitness standards. In frustration, Bhanuka Rajapaksa decided to retire at the young age of 30, but took back his retirement upon the request of the sports minister.  <br/>  <br/> Rajapaksa was then named in his squad for an ODI series away to Australia, where he performed admirably. His crowning moment for Sri Lanka though came in the 2022 Asia Cup, where Rajapaksa was asked to play the role of a finisher. He played vital cameos against India and Bangladesh, in must win games for Sri Lanka. Then in the final, Rajapaksa scored an unbeaten 71 against Pakistan to rescue Sri Lanka from 58/5 to post a total 170 runs. Sri Lanka picked up an unfancied win while batting first in the UAE, deservedly claiming the 2022 Asia Cup.  <br/>  <br/> Rajapaksa was picked for the first time in the IPL in 2022, and fit in perfectly with the brand of cricket Punjab Kings were trying to play. His devil may care attitude towards attacking cricket made for some entertaining viewing in the IPL, despite not always getting results. ",

      "bio": "A left handed top-order batsman and a wicket-keeper. Sounds all too familiar in the Sri Lankan circuit. Niroshan Dickwella presents himself as yet another one of these all-round options. Like most of the young Sri Lankan batsmen to have made it big, Dickwella’s majot claim to fame was his Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 2012 when he amassed over 1000 runs to lead Trinity College to the title. The transformation upwards saw him become a regular for his domestic side, Nondescripts Cricket Club, keeping wickets and opening the batting. He soon earned a reputation for himself of being a highly attacking option in the limited overs format.  <br/>  <br/> Consistent performances and impressive ones in the big matches, such as his quickfire century in the final of the Inter-Provincial One-Day tournament in 2013 saw the selectors promote him to the ‘A’ side and very soon into the national squad. With Dinesh Chandimal, the regular keeper injured, Dickwella got his first Test cap against South Africa in 2014.  <br/>  <br/> The start to his international career has been pretty promising especially in the shorter formats. In the rebuilding phase that Sri Lanka is going through, he remains one of the upcoming players the selectors would look to bank upon to carry the mantle for a long time.  <br/>  <br/> But unfortunately he was overlooked for the 2019 World Cup as Kusal Perera was preferred over him. But with age on his side it would be mighty surprising that he doesn't feature in a WC squad for the Lankans in the future. But yes, it is also true that Kusal Perera will always keep him on his toes.  <br/>  <br/> Niroshan has often been criticized of throwing his wicket away but his thrill-a-minute ride while batting also is his USP. In a phase where Lankan cricket needs a massive face lift, Niroshan won't mind being of the men who would help Sri Lankan cricket to turn a new corner. <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Vineet Anantharaman</b> and <b>Kumar Abhisekh Das</b>",

      "bio": "Shakib Al Hasan is without a doubt the biggest name to have emerged from Bangladesh cricket circles. Being a genuine all-rounder, Shakib is a vital cog in Bangladesh's line-up. He has been a consistent performer for his country, over the years. Shakib first came into notice when he played cricket for several villages near his hometown of Magura. He spent time honing his skills at a government run sports facility and was picked for the Under-19 squad for the tri-series featuring England and Sri Lanka. He scored a 86-ball century and picked up three wickets in the final to help the team defeat Sri Lanka. This earned him selection for the series against Zimbabwe.  <br/>  <br/> He cracked his first ODI ton against Canada in the tri-series played in the West Indies, just before the 2007 World Cup. He scored a composed fifty and bowled 10 tight overs for 44 runs without a wicket as Bangladesh secured a big win over India. His consistent performances enhanced his reputation. He went on to score a century against Pakistan, later in the year.  <br/>  <br/> In the Test arena, Shakib continued in the same vein as he had done in the ODIs. His major breakthrough came in the Test against New Zealand in Chittagong in 2008. He picked up 7/36, which till date is the best figures by a Bangladeshi bowler. Shakib also contributed with a fifty in the second innings to set New Zealand a challenging 317. However, he got no support from the other bowlers and New Zealand won the match.  <br/>  <br/> Shakib was ranked No. 1 among the all-rounders by the ICC thanks to his consistency. He took over the captaincy from Mohammad Ashraful and led from the front. He picked up five wickets and went on to score an unbeaten 96 in the second Test in Grenada against a depleted West Indies side. Bangladesh eventually won the Test series 3-0.  <br/>  <br/> Shakib's stint with Worcestershire made him even better. He took 35 wickets in a single season, including his best figures of 7/32 against Middlesex to help the County get promoted to Division 1 of the championship. Along the way, he was the leading wicket-taker and run-scorer when Bangladesh achieved a whitewash over New Zealand in 2010.  <br/>  <br/> Despite leading Bangladesh to wins against England, Ireland and Netherlands in the 2011 World Cup, the team crashed out and many people blamed Shakib. He put aside all the criticism and performed well for Kolkata in the 2011 IPL.  <br/>  <br/> Shakib was sacked as captain before the tour of West Indies in 2011. However, he yet again proved his worth as he was Bangladesh's leading wicket-taker in both the ODI and Test series in the West Indies. His bowling was backed up by 168 runs he scored in two Tests. He scored 79 from two innings in the ODIs. Bangladesh lost both series. Later in the year, Shakib was Bangladesh's top run-scorer and wicket-taker in the home Test series against Pakistan in December 2011. In the second Test of the series, he became Bangladesh's first player to score a century and take five wickets in an innings. After the series, he was ranked No. 1 in the ICC's ranking of Test allrounders.  <br/>  <br/> The Bangladesh Cricket Board launched Bangladesh Premier League in 2012, a Twenty20 tournament to be held in February that year. The BCB made Shakib the 'Icon Player' for Khulna Royal Bengals. Under his captaincy, Shakib's team progressed to the semi-finals of the competition, where they were beaten by Dhaka Gladiators. In 10 matches, he scored 280 runs and took 15 wickets, and he was his team's leading wicket-taker and later he was named Man of the Tournament.  <br/>  <br/> In the 2012 Asia Cup, Shakib scored 237 runs, including three fifties and also took six wickets. Bangladesh progressed to the final of the tournament for the first time, where they lost to Pakistan by two runs. Shakib's performance earned him the Player of the Tournament award and he reclaimed the No.1 ODI allrounder spot from Australia's Shane Watson. Later that year in the 2012 edition of the IPL, Shakib played in eight of Kolkata's 18 matches and won two Man of the Match awards as the team won the IPL for the first time.  <br/>  <br/> During the home series against West Indies in 2012, Shakib became the second Bangladeshi player to take 100 Test wickets, making him the leading wicket-taker in Tests for Bangladesh. He also achieved the feat of becoming the fastest allrounder to take 100 wickets and score 1,000 runs. He achieved the milestone in just 28 matches. However, he was ruled out of the ODI and T20 series due to a shin injury.  <br/>  <br/> In the 2013 BPL player auction, Shakib was snapped up for a whopping amount of USD 365,000 by Dhaka Gladiators, making him the most expensive player of the tournament. He led his team to victory, getting 329 runs and 15 wickets in 12 matches and emerging as the Man of the Tournament for a consecutive second time in the BPL. Shakib signed up for Leicestershire County Cricket Club as their second overseas player for T20 matches. In the Caribbean Premier League 2013, Shakib played as an allrounder for Barbados Tridents. In a match against Trinidad and Tobago Steel, he recorded the second best T20 bowling figures by taking 6/6 from his four overs.  <br/>  <br/> During the series against Sri Lanka in February 2014, he was punished by the BCB for making an inappropriate gesture on live television during the second ODI against Sri Lanka. He was also fined 300,000 Takas (3800 USD) and was suspended for the next three matches, which included the first two matches of the 2014 Asia Cup. He was their best bowler in the World T20 2014 and also scored a fine 66 against Australia, but still couldn't help his side win a single contest in the Super 10s. A few months later in June 2014, Shakib was allegedly involved in a brawl with a spectator, who was reportedly harassing his wife in the grandstand of Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium, during the first ODI against India. His 'severe attitude problem' over the months forced the BCB to ban him for six months from all forms of cricket. The ban was reduced to three and a half months, allowing him to be available for selection from September 15.  <br/>  <br/> In November 2014, Shakib joined Imran Khan and Ian Botham, becoming only the third player in the history to have scored a hundred and taken 10 wickets in the same Test. He achieved this feat against Zimbabwe. He performed admirably in the ODI series that followed, as well. In December 2014, the BCB finally ended the restriction on non-objection certificate, leaving him free to participate in overseas tournaments. In the same month, he was signed by the Melbourne Renegades to play in the Big Bash League. <br/>   <br/> Post the successful World Cup campaign in 2015, Bangladesh continued their good form in the 50-over format. The consistent Shakib played a huge factor in his team’s hat-trick of ODI series victories - against Pakistan, India and South Africa - all at home. Barring his unbeaten 50 against Pakistan, Shakib didn’t have a great WT20 held in India in 2016 and that didn’t help his team’s cause as they failed to register a single win the Super 10 stage. He terms the one-run defeat against India in Bengaluru and the 2012 Asia Cup final loss as two of his major cricket regrets he would like to erase. <br/>   <br/> Although Shakib didn’t contribute much with the bat, he played the perfect foil to debutant Mehedi Hasan. The all-rounder picked 12 wickets in two matches and helped his team square the 2-match Test series 1-1, that also involved Bangladesh’s first Test victory against England. The tour to New Zealand saw Shakib reach greater heights when he amassed 217 runs in the first innings at Wellington. He was involved in a record 359-run stand with Rahim. But, he followed it up with a duck before Bangladesh collapsed and lost the game posting a gigantic score of 595 in the first essay. <br/>   <br/> After a decent outing in the one-off Test against India, Shakib had a superb tour of Sri Lanka. Shakib notched up his fifth Test ton in Bangladesh’s historic 100th Test match. That knock proved to be instrumental in Bangladesh winning the match and squaring the series 1-1. He was the Man of the Series for scoring 162 runs and taking 9 wickets. He was the standout player in the shortest format as well as his all-round performances helped Bangladesh level the T20I series 1-1. After Mortaza announced his retirement from the 20-over format, the BCB appointed Shakib as the T20I skipper. <br/>  <br/> Shakib Al Hasan was a part of the Kolkata Knight Riders from 2011 and he played quite a few match winning knocks till he was a part of the team till 2017. With his excellent all-round skills, Shakib Al Hasan proved his worth as an ace all-rounder playng for KKR. Sunrisers Hyderabad got him in the auctions ahead of IPL 2018 where Shakib claimed 14 wickets in the season and scored 230-plus runs for them. However, the Knight Riders got him back in IPL auction 2023 at a price of 1.5 crores. In the presence of overseas all-rounders like Andre Russell, Sunil Narine and David Wiese, it will be interesting to see whether Shakib gets a chance to feature in the playing XI.",

      "bio": "When the world talks about the sub-continental openers, they talk about the aggression factor. Virender Sehwag, Sanath Jayasuriya and Sachin Tendulkar have ruthlessly destroyed bowling attacks over the years. However, an opener from Bangladesh soon joined that list and made the world take notice.  <br/>  <br/> He scored his first century against Ireland, but it was his knock against Zimbabwe at Harare in 2009 which got him top billing. Charles Coventry remained unbeaten when he equalled Saeed Anwar's highest ODI score of 194. However, Tamim launched a brutal counterattack to smash the highest score by a Bangladeshi batsman. His 154 included seven fours and six sixes as Bangladesh went on to win the match.  <br/>  <br/> He started off his Test debut in style by scoring a pair of fifties against New Zealand in Dunedin in 2008. He scored his maiden Test century against the West Indies in 2009 at Kingstown to help Bangladesh record their first overseas test win. He also smashed 151 against India at Dhaka. One of his most memorable moments came on the tour to England when he got his name on the Honours Board at Lord’s by becoming the first Bangladeshi player to score a century. He scored another ton at Old Trafford to cap off a wonderful summer. His performances in that tour led to Wisden naming him as the Cricketer of the year in 2011.  <br/>  <br/> In March 2012 Bangladesh hosted the Asia Cup. Tamim, who was recovering from typhoid, was initially dropped from the squad on the orders of BCB president Mustafa Kamal. Controversy ensued as Kamal had overridden selection committee and Tamim was eventually re-added to the squad. He responded by striking four consecutive half-centuries, becoming the first Bangladesh player to achieve the feat in ODIs.   <br/>  <br/> After the 2015 World Cup, with scores of 132, 116 and 64 in the three-match ODI series, he was the Man of the Series and played an instrumental role in whitewashing Pakistan for the first time. He continued his good work in the Tests as well, notching up a double century in Khulna in the second innings which helped Bangladesh secure a draw for the first time against Pakistan in the longest format. He was also a key member of the Bangladesh set-up that tasted series victories against India and South Africa in the same year.  <br/>  <br/> Tamim opted out of the 2016 Asia Cup due to the birth of his first child. However, he was back for ICC WT20, 2016 held in India. The opener was in red-hot form in the qualifiers He scored an unbeaten 83 versus Netherlands and in a must-win encounter against Oman, he struck 103 off just 63 deliveries and became the first Bangladeshi to score a T20I century - thereby becoming the first from his nation to score centuries across all formats.   <br/>  <br/> Tamim became the first Bangladeshi batsman to amass 5000 ODI runs - he reached the milestone against England in October 2016. Carrying the good form into the longest format, Tamim slammed his eighth Test ton at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium and backed it up with a fiery 40 in the second essay that helped Bangladesh post their first ever Test win against England and thereby drawing the 2-match series 1-1.  <br/>  <br/> He set the 2017 Champions Trophy in England ablaze with a scintillating 128 in the tournament opener and followed it up with scores of 95, 0 and 70. Although Bangladesh lost to India in the semis, they surpassed expectations of many by knocking both Antipodean nations out of the tournament.  <br/>  <br/> <i>World Cup through the years</i> <br/>  <br/> Tamim Iqbal was chosen in the Bangladesh team for the 2007 World Cup after playing just two matches against Zimbabwe. Against India, they were chasing a low score in tricky condition and he launched into the Indian bowling attack with brutal aggression. His six over deep mid-wicket after skipping down the track to Zaheer was among the shots of the 2007 World Cup. Tamim scored a fifty and more importantly the manner in which he scored them helped Bangladesh post a historic win over India. Tamim struggled with inconsistency post that and scored only 172 runs from 9 games in the tourney.  <br/>  <br/> After a decent series against Zimbabwe in Nov-Dec 2014, Tamim was diagnosed as a grade one tear on his left knee. He underwent a surgery in Australia and recovered in time before the 2015 World Cup. However, he didn't have a great tournament as he managed just 154 runs in six innings, with a best score of 95 against Scotland which provided the platform to chase down a target of 319. <br/>  <br/> Barring a couple of brisk starts, Tamim hardly made any impact with the bat in the 2019 World Cup which was held in England.  <br/>  <br/> A 'partially fit' Tamim was left out of the 2023 World Cup after a prolonged saga - a back injury, a shocking retirement from international from all formats, reversing that decision and unretiring the very next day after meeting the then Bangladesh Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, and then eventually stepping down as the ODI captain. He also hit out at BCB a day after being omitted from the 2023 WC squad. In between all of those episodes, Tamim played his final international match in an ODI against New Zealand in September 2023.  <br/>  <br/> In January 2025, Tamim Iqbal confirmed retirement from international cricket after discussions with the national selection panel ahead of the Champions Trophy.",

      "bio": "An absolute livewire behind the stumps, Mushfiqur Rahim, fits the clichéd description of wicket-keepers aptly. He is short, very quick behind the stumps, always chuntering away and a brilliant batsman as well. He was initially picked as an understudy to Khaled Mashud for the tour of England in 2005, but as he impressed everyone with his competence with the bat in the tour games, he was made to play as a specialist batsman in the first Test at the age of 16. He thus became the youngest player to play at Lord's. An ankle injury forced him out of the side for a while before being recalled to the side for the tour of Zimbabwe in 2006. His consistent performances saw him pip Mashud as the first choice wicket-keeper for the 2007 World Cup in West Indies. He was soon a part of the Test squad, too, and sealed his spot with a 80 against Sri Lanka in only his third Test.  <br/>  <br/> He continued to make consistent contributions down the order with the bat and was more than competent as a keeper for Bangladesh's spin dominated attack. His moment of fame came in 2010 in a Test against India. He scored a quickfire century, the quickest by any Bangladeshi, and impressed many people with his sound technique. It did not help Bangladesh save defeat, but it certainly put him in the limelight. In fact, Bangladesh look up to him, and a few other talented youngsters, to take them forward.  <br/>  <br/> The Bangladesh Cricket Board then launched the six-team BPL in 2012. The BCB made Mushfiqur the 'Icon Player' for Duronto Rajshahi. Under his leadership, Duronto overcame a poor start to progress to the semifinals, where they lost to Barisal Burners. Rahim scored 234 runs from 11 matches in that season. In the 2012 Asia Cup, under Rahim's captaincy, Bangladesh won two out of the three games they played and reached the final for the first time, where they lost to Pakistan. In April, his grade A+ central contract was renewed. On 11th March 2013, during the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle, Rahim became the first Bangladeshi to score a double hundred, bettering the previous highest of 190 set by Mohammad Ashraful, earlier in the day.  <br/>  <br/> On May 8, 2013, Mushfiqur resigned from captaincy, but a few days later, announced that he had made a mistake and on July 3, 2013, the BCB said that they would be retaining Rahim as captain until the end of the year. Rahim had an outstanding home series against New Zealand in October and in November 2013, his team drew the first two Tests, won all the three ODIs and lost the only T20I match.  <br/> He scored his second ODl century against India in the beginning of the 2014 Asia Cup, but struggled in that match with an injury. Rahim continued to play in the next match against Afghanistan, but the hosts lost the match by 32 runs which was a great disappointment for him and his team. He captained his side in the 2014 World T20, being the hosts, they could not live up to the expectations of the fans as they lost all their matches after qualifying for the main tournament.  <br/>  <br/> Bangladesh toured West Indies in August 2014 and were not able to win a single game. However, Rahim showed his worth by scoring his third Test ton. In September 2014, it was announced that Mashrafe Mortaza will be taking over the ODI captaincy while Rahim continue to be the skipper for the longer format. In the home series that followed, he was the leading run-scorer in ODIs, amassing 213 runs in five matches, including two half-centuries. He was also named the Man of the Series for the tournament.  <br/> Rahim had a brilliant World Cup personally with the bat in Australia. He gathered 298 runs in six matches. His major contribution. He put on a 141-run stand with Mahmudullah against England that helped his team reach the quarterfinal of the tournament for the first time.  <br/>  <br/> He carried his good form with the bat post World Cup as well. He blasted 220 runs in three ODI matches against a visiting Pakistan team which was blanked 3-0 by the hosts. Rahim was an integral member of the Bangladesh team that tasted success against India and South Africa in the 50-over format at home.  <br/> Rahim’s biggest disappointment will have to be the 2016 edition of WT20 held in India where he couldn’t guide his team home against the hosts from a winning position. After hitting back-to-back boundaries off India’s Hardik Pandya, Bangladesh needed just 2 runs in 3 balls, when Rahim went for the glory shot and perished. Bangladesh eventually lost the game by one run and failed to register a single win in the Super 10 stage.  <br/>  <br/> Bangladesh’s next big assignment was against a visiting England team. Having lost the ODI series 1-2, the Asian team were keen to put a better show in the longest format under the captaincy of Rahim. After losing the first game by a close margin of 22 runs, Rahim and Co. won the second match (first Test win for Bangladesh against England) from behind and squared the series 1-1.  <br/> Wanting to prove a point away from home, Bangladesh’s most experienced duo - Shakib and Rahim - stitched together a record stand of 359 runs for the fifth wicket with the latter scoring 159, that helped Bangladesh post a mammoth score of 595. When Rahim and Sabbir Rahman were digging it out for a draw in the second essay, a bouncer from Tim Southee hit Rahim’s back of the helmet and he had to be taken off the field. Bangladesh lost the game and in Rahim’s absence lost the second Test as well.  <br/>  <br/> In the one-off Test against India in Hyderabad, he slammed his fifth ton against the likes of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in a losing cause. A month later, Rahim’s Bangladesh toured Sri Lanka. Losing the first Test by a huge margin, Bangladesh came back strongly to win the second game - which was also their historic 100th Test match. In the same match, Rahim became the 41st wicketkeeper in Test history and the first Bangladeshi to reach 100 Test dismissals. <br/>   <br/> Prior to the Champions Trophy, Rahim had a good outing with the bat in the tri-series held in Ireland. His run-a-ball 45 in the final game of the series, not only fetched him the Man of the Match award, but also put Bangladesh above Sri Lanka in the rankings.Rahim had a fairly successful outing in the 2017 Champions Trophy hosted by England, racking up two fifties from four innings. His form coupled with a semifinal finish for Bangladesh meant that it was overall a satisfactory tournament for the team.   <br/>  <br/> However, bad phases are inevitable in life and Rahim found that the hard way during the tour of South Africa that followed. The trip consisting of two Tests, three ODIs and two T20Is saw Bangladesh being whitewashed across all the formats. The one-sided defeats in the Tests (where he is captain) saw him being under the pump from all corners. He had a have good time in the white-ball format though, as he conjured a ton and a fifty in the three-match series. The absence of the captaincy pressures probably helped him to express himself better. <br/>  <br/> Rahim will hope to continue his good form and also look to lead by example. Considering the way he broke down to criticism during the Test disaster in South Africa, he would be better advised to be more calm in his approach. Rahim was removed from captaincy after that tour. His excitable nature has often been his undoing during crunch moments and one hopes he gets rid of it gradually to become a better player.  <br/>  <br/> <b>By Abhinand Raghavendran and Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "Like Sanath Jayasuriya, Kevin Pietersen, Shoaib Malik, Steve Smith and many more, Mahmudullah started his career as a bowler and then converted into a batsman who could bowl handy off-breaks. He became the first Bangladeshi World Cup centurion when he scored 103 against England at the Adelaide Oval that helped his team reach the knockout stage for the first time.  <br/>  <br/> Born in Mymensingh, Mahmudullah made his first-class debut for Bangladesh A at the age of 19 and posted scores of 55 and 42 against Zimbabwe A. He made his debut in international cricket in an ODI against Sri Lanka in July 2007 and made an instant impact picking up 2 wickets and scored 36 runs but the effort went in vain as Bangladesh came up short. The performance was enough to convince the selectors to pick him for the tour to Kenya and the T20 World Cup later that year.  He was briefly dropped from the side in 2008 but worked his way back with phenomenal domestic performances to earn a recall. <br/>  <br/> Mahmudullah made his Test debut on 9 July 2009 against the West Indies and made a dream start to his career in whites. He failed with the bat, but produced the best bowling figures for a Bangladeshi on debut. He took 8 wickets in the match, including a 5-wicket haul in the second innings to help Bangladesh seal their first ever win abroad. The match figures remain his best till date.  <br/> After the series win against West Indies, Mahmudullah found his rhythm with the bat in the longest format. He put up five scores of more than fifty in five consecutive matches, which also included his maiden Test ton against New Zealand at Hamilton. Although Mahmudullah scored that Test century batting at number 8, the selection committee preferred not to promote him up the order due to his perceived weakness against fast bowling, despite the number four spot having no permanent occupant. <br/>   <br/> Batting at number 7, Mahmudullah scored lots of runs in ODIs and he was picked for the 2011 World Cup, where he shared a vital partnership with Shafiul Islam to take Bangladesh to victory against England. After the World Cup, Mahmudullah was named as Bangladesh's vice-captain, taking over from Tamim Iqbal. When West Indies toured in October, Mahmudullah missed all the matches with a viral fever. He recovered in time to rejoin the squad to face Pakistan in three ODIs in November, where he scored 56 runs and bowled in just one match, taking three wickets from seven deliveries.  <br/>  <br/> There was a dip in his form and he couldn't score runs freely in the home series against Sri Lanka in February 2014. In the subsequent Asia Cup 2014, he struggled to take wickets on a regular basis. His poor form continued in the 2014 World T20 which saw Bangladesh lose all their matches in the Super 10s. However, he rediscovered his touch just in the nick of time which enabled his selection for the 2015 World Cup. <br/>  <br/> By far, Mahmudullah was the best Bangladesh batsman in the 2015 World Cup. His century knocked England out of the tournament and he backed it up with another ton, an unbeaten 128 against the co-hosts New Zealand, albeit in a losing cause. Overall, he scored 365 in seven innings which helped his team secure a berth in the quarters, where they were eventually beaten by India.  <br/>  <br/> That tournament was a turning point for Mahmudullah as he hasn't looked back ever since.  He has played quite a few impact knocks after that, mostly in the lower middle order where he takes charge of finishing the innings for Bangladesh.  His presence lends extra stability to the batting. Mahmudullah continues to be a regular member in the Bangladesh set-up across all formats despite his inconsistency in Tests.  He has performed decently in red-ball cricket but it won't be wrong to say that he has under-achieved. In recent years,  <br/>  <br/> <b>By Abhinand Raghavendran and Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "Popularly known as the 'Narail Express', Mortaza's career has been beset by injuries. The first real quick bowler to come out of Bangladesh, he was earmarked for great things since the time he made his test debut against Zimbabwe in 2001-02. Stockily built, he could generate uncomfortable bounce with his strong action.  <br/>  <br/> He impressed Andy Roberts who was then coaching Bangladesh and was drafted into the Test side - in what was his debut first-class game as well - he was the 31st person to have achieved this, and the third since 1899. After his Test debut, injuries started wreaking havoc and he found himself making one comeback after the other. Injuries to his back and knee forced him to miss most of the action, but came back and broke Aftab Ahmed's national record, en-route to taking 6/26 against Kenya in an ODI.  <br/>  <br/> In the calendar year of 2006, Mortaza was the world's highest wicket taker in ODIs, collecting 49 wickets. The haul was the most ever in a calendar year by a Bangladeshi, and 17th most for anyone. He was the Man of the Match in his side's shock victory over India in the 2007 World Cup taking 4/38. Unsurprisingly he played in all of Bangladesh's matches in the World Cup as they reached the second round.  <br/>  <br/> Mortaza's strengths are hitting the deck and getting appreciable movement off the seam. When he is at his peak, he was capable of surprising the batsmen with his sheer pace, but constant injuries have meant that he has remodeled his action and relies mostly on bowling a restrictive line with an emphasis on eking out an error from the batsmen.  <br/>  <br/> A capable lower order batsman, who can use the long handle to good effect, Mortaza was picked up by the KKR side $600,000 in February 2009. He had a shock debut with them when he conceded 26 runs in the last over to Rohit Sharma when 21 was required who snatched an almost impossible win. That was the only game he played in the season as the franchisee consigned him to the benches.  <br/>  <br/> Mortaza was appointed captain after the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean. He was to debut as captain when Bangladesh toured West Indies and Zimbabwe, but an ankle injury forced him to hand over the captaincy duties to Shakib. He suffered a tear in his knee ligament which forced him to miss the 2011 World Cup. He hoped to recover in time, and when it was announced that Mortaza had not been included in the World Cup squad there was rioting in Bangladesh and in one place a half-day strike.  <br/>  <br/> The Bangladesh Cricket Board started the Bangladesh Premier League in 2012, a Twenty20 tournament to be held in February 2012. In the player auction Mortaza was snapped up by the Dhaka Gladiators for 45,000 USD. On his return to competitive cricket, Mortaza was made the captain of Dhaka Gladiators. Before the tournament had started, he reported to have been approached with a request to participate in spot-fixing. Mortaza led his team Dhaka Gladiators to the title in the inaugural edition of BPL, where he took ten wickets from eleven matches.  <br/>  <br/> Shortly after BPL concluded, Bangladesh hosted the 2012 Asia Cup. After losing to Pakistan the previous December, five new players were called into Bangladesh's 15-man squad, including Mortaza who was making his comeback to the national side after an injury. When the BCB announced its central contracts for 2012 in March, Mortaza retained his top level contract. Bangladesh exceeded all expectations and progressed to the final against Pakistan, it was just the second time that Bangladesh had reached the final of a tournament. Though he had played in the BPL, bowling ten overs in the ODIs proved to be a challenge for Mortaza. He struggled to bowl his quota of 10 overs, but finished as Bangladesh's leading seamer with six wickets from four matches. Even after being in and out of the squad Mortaza was able to retain his top level central contract with BCB in March 2012.  <br/>  <br/> Mortaza has been seen as a short form bowler. He has not played a Test match since 2009 and he injured himself again while playing the 2014 T20 World Cup. In the match against Pakistan, he equalled the record for the most runs conceded by a Bangladeshi bowler in T20Is. He was the third highest wicket taker in the Nov-Dec 2014 series against Zimbabwe. He was appointed as skipper for the series after the captaincy was split across formats for the first time. The BCB, being happy with his ODI captaincy, asked him to lead the team in the 2015 World Cup as well, where he did a tremendous job leading Bangladesh to the quarterfinal (the first time Bangladesh had made it to the knockouts). <br/>  <br/> After the 2015 World Cup, Mashrafe led his team to ODI series wins against Pakistan (3-0) and India (2-1) at home. These results sealed a place for Bangladesh in the 8-nation tournament, the 2017 edition of the Champions Trophy in England. Mashrafe, who had a few thoughts of retirement put them all to rest and wanted to work harder for the tourney.. After registering an ODI series win against the Proteas, the Bangladesh captain said, 'We used to dream of beating big teams. Now we are beating them.' <br/>  <br/> After finishing runners-up in the Asia Cup, Mashrafe’s next assignment was the WT20 held in India. A different Mortaza was seen midway during the tournament. In one of the press conferences, he was seen shedding tears when asked about the suspensions of Taskin Ahmed and Arafat Sunny for illegal bowling actions. The Bangladesh certainly missed their services and failed to register a single win in the Super 10 stage.  <br/>  <br/> After squaring the ODI series in Sri Lanka, Mortaza announced his retirement from the shortest format of the game at the toss during the first of the two T20Is. His teammates gave him a fitting farewell by winning his final T20I game and thereby leveling the series 1-1.  <br/>  <br/> On beating New Zealand in the final game of the tri-series in Ireland in May 2017, Bangladesh went above Sri Lanka in the rankings to sixth place. Taking confidence from the heartening show in the Ireland tri-series, Bangladesh beat New Zealand once again in the 2017 Champions Trophy as they reached the semi-final for the first time in the history of the tournament. They were eventually beaten by India but returned home to a rousing welcome.  <br/>  <br/> After a slow start, Bangladesh have started to emerge as a dominant force - at least in the shorter formats of the game and much of the credit must go to the man who's leading his team towards glory. <br/>  <br/> <i>Interesting facts:</i> Although he enjoyed playing sports such as football and badminton from a young age - sometimes going swimming in the nearby River Chitra instead of doing school work - Mortaza was more interested in cricket as a youth, especially batting.  <br/>  <br/> He is very popular in his home town, leading to him being dubbed their 'Prince of Hearts'.  <br/>  <br/> At Govt. Victoria College, Narail, Mortaza met Sumona Haque Shumi, whom he married in 2006 <br/>  <br/>  <br/> <b>By Abhinand Raghavendran</b> <br/>  <br/> ",

      "bio": "Mustafizur Rahman is a wily left-arm pacer that foxes batters with his ever growing arsenal of slower deliveries and cutters. Now a seasoned campaigner, it was a nineteen-year-old Mustafizur Rahman who grabbed attention during India's tour of Bangladesh (June 2015) when he became the second bowler in ODI history after Zimbabwe's Brian Vitori to pick up two five-wicket hauls in his first two matches. In fact, he is the only bowler to take a total of 11 wickets in his first two games. In his 3rd ODI against India, he took 2 wickets and made history by taking 13 wickets in a 3-match ODI series.  <br/>  <br/> Rahman, who has been playing cricket from a very young age, was first spotted by scouts from Satkhira and picked him up to play in the Under-17 tournaments before calling him up for pace bowling camps in Dhaka. His obvious talent did not take long to get noticed and before he knew it, he became a regular part of Bangladesh's Under-19 squad. He represented Bangladesh in the Under-19 World Cup in 2014 and picked up 9 wickets in six matches. His first-class debut came in the 2013-14 season as well for Khulna and he started giving commendable performances, thus sealing his spot in the team. He finished the first-class season with 26 wickets at an average of 19.08.  <br/>  <br/> Mustafizur made his international debut in a one-off T20 match against Pakistan and picked up two wickets, that of Shahid Afridi and Mohammad Hafeez. He was handed the ODI cap in the series against India and instantly impressed with his accuracy and variations. Mustafizur made his Test debut against South Africa in July 2015. He picked up four wickets in his first match and became the first player to win 'Man of the Match' award on both Test as well as One Day International debuts.  <br/>  <br/> Having befuddled the Indian batsmen with his varieties in the ODI series, Mustafizur Rahman, often called as ‘The Fizz’, was bagged by Sunrisers Hyderabad for INR 1.4 crore. Soon, he signed a contract with Sussex for the T20 Blast competition. His first tourney outside home was the World T20 held in India in 2016. He missed the initial matches due to side strain, but that didn’t affect his performance later in the tournament. He returned home as Bangladesh’s best bowler picking 9 wickets in 3 games, which also featured a fifer (5-22) against New Zealand. <br/>   <br/> Following the WT20, Rahman showcased his brilliance with the ball in the lucrative Indian Premier League, where his team won the coveted trophy. Playing for the Sunrisers, he scalped 16 wickets in 17 matches, thereby being named ‘Emerging Player of the Tournament'. <br/>   <br/> A shoulder injury during his stint with Sussex kept him out of action for six months, which meant he had to miss the important home series against England. In December 2016, he was part of the Bangladesh team that toured New Zealand and played in the ODIs and T20Is. Though he was in the squad for the longest format, as he wasn’t 100% fit, the management decided to rest him. The selectors bravely omitted him for the one-off Test against India as he hadn’t fully recovered from the hamstring problem.  <br/>  <br/> Having recovered fully from injuries, the Fizz played a key role in Bangladesh’s successful tour of Sri Lanka in 2017, where the tourists squared the Test, ODI and T20I series. Mustafizur joined the SRH camp late for the 2017 edition of IPL. His services were required for just one match in which he went wicketless and had to leave for Ireland for the tri-series featuring the hosts and New Zealand. Rahman was the best Bangladeshi bowler in the tri-series which also included a Man of the Match award against Ireland. <br/>   <br/> Mustafizur had a very silent campaign in the 2017 Champions Trophy in England. He returned just a solitary wicket from four games and wasn't at his best even in the two-match Test series at home against Australia that followed although he did have a 4-fer in the second innings of the final Test. Like most of his Bangladeshi teammates, he also had a rather disappointing tour of South Africa. He featured only in the Tests and was ruled out of the ODIs due to an ankle injury. A fit and firing Mustafizur Rahman was mandatory for Bangladesh cricket, especially in the shorter forms. <br/>  <br/> A regular in the Bangladesh side by now, Mustafizur was named in Bangladesh’s squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup and he had an excellent campaign. He bagged his 100th ODI wicket in their game against Pakistan and went on to finish the tournament as his side’s leading wicket taker with 20 wickets from just 8 outings.  <br/>  <br/> After a steady stint with the Sunrisers, Mustafizur found himself hopping around franchises in the coming years. He was bought by the Mumbai Indians in 2018 and picked up 7 wickets from as many games before going on to miss the following season due to injury. In 2020, he was denied an NOC by the Bangladesh Cricket Board who stated that he was required for national duty. He returned to the IPL in 2021 after being bought by the Rajasthan Royals and had another consistent season where he claimed 14 wickets from 14 games. He switched sides again in 2022 when he was acquired by the Delhi Capitals.   <br/>  <br/> 'A remember the name’ moment happened for Mustafizur when he picked up 11 wickets in his first two ODIs to derail India. The Fizz as many call him since then has seen many ups and downs in his career. His international career has been plagued by all sorts of injuries. <br/>  <br/> <b>By Abhinand Raghavendran and Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "Born in Dinanjpur, Liton Das is a Bangladeshi opening batsman and wicket-keeper, who was a part of the 2012 and 2014 Under-19 World Cup team and shone in both the editions with the bat and had been touted as the next big thing in Bangladesh cricket.  <br/>  <br/> He made his first-class debut in October 2011 for Rangpur Division against Dhaka Division. He didn't have a great first season, but fought back strongly in the following season registering a ton and a half-century. His career was boosted after his performances in the 2014 U-19 World Cup held in Abu Dhabi, where he scored 239 runs in just four innings.  <br/>  <br/> Post the heroics in the Under-19 tournament, Liton developed into a better player and that was evident in his domestic outings. He ended up as the second highest run-getter in the Dhaka Premier League and then amplified the performances in the longer format. From second best in List A, Liton went onto top the run-charts in the National Cricket League playing for Rangpur Division. He struck five centuries and aggregated more than 1000 runs finishing the season with a mind-boggling average of 85.33.  <br/>  <br/> Das made his Test debut against India in June 2015. He played some eye-pleasing strokes before he fell for 44 off 45 balls. He bettered his performance against the then ranked one team, South Africa, and registered his maiden Test fifty. He hasn't showcased his talents in the shorter formats and that has resulted in an in-and-out selection in the national team. He faces a stiff competition with Nurul Hasan to don the gloves whenever Mushfiqur Rahim misses an international game.  <br/>  <br/> Das was recalled into the Test side in March 2017 against away tour of Sri Lanka and he did just enough to keep his place in the side for the next couple of tours which included an away series with South Africa. He is fine talent and has some serious numbers in the domestic circuit, particularly in the longer format. A batsman who likes to keep things moving, Das is a shotmaker who can put the pressure back on the opposition in a jiffy. His keeping skills are also quite good and with Rahim abandoning the gloves, a lot will be expected of young Das to make the keeper batsman slot his own in Tests. He has strictly decent numbers in red-ball cricket for Bangladesh while his ODI stats are disappointing thus far. However, it's still early days in his career and with the kind of talent he has, it shouldn't be long before he turns things around. <br/>  <br/> What to expect in the 2019 WC? <br/>  <br/> A reserve wicket-keeper or a frontline batter, Liton Das has carved a niche for himself as both after his destructive and valiant ton against India in the Asia Cup finale. A sweet timer of the cricket ball, Liton deals with pace and spin with equal elan. Liton's place in the side might come at the expense of an injury or may be a different tactic, but he would carry good form into the tournament having scored well in the tournament in Ireland just before the World Cup. <br/>  <br/> Liton Das might not get to keep during the tournament but he is neat and pretty quick behind the sticks. And breaking into a line up possessing the likes of Tamim, Rahim, Shakib and Mahmudullah won't be easy but Liton would want to grab at every chance thrown at him during his maiden WC. <br/>  <br/> <b>By Abhinand Raghavendran and Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "A tall, right-hand fast bowler, Taskin Ahmed grabbed headlines at a very young age - thanks to his pace. He is currently the second fastest Bangladeshi bowler having clocked 148kph (the fastest is Rubel's 149.5kph). He made his first-class debut in the 2011 season playing for Dhaka Metropolis at the age of 16. He was selected for the Under-19 World Cup which was held in Australia in the year 2012. Taskin ended up as the leading wicket-taker in that tournament. Playing in just his second T20 match for Chittagong Kings in the 2013 edition of the Bangladesh Premier League, Taskin was named the Man of the Match for his splendid figures of 4/31. <br/>  <br/> He had to undergo a knee surgery and was out of action for almost a year. He worked hard and made his international debut in the WT20 game against Australia in 2014. In less than two months, Taskin made his ODI debut against the visiting Indian team and had a memorable game. He finished with figures of 5/28. He was just 3-matches old, but his pace forced the selectors to pick him for the 2015 ICC World Cup that was hosted by Australia and New Zealand. Taskin was Bangladesh's highest wicket taker in the tournament. His wickets of James Taylor and Jos Buttler in the must-win encounter against England helped his team book a berth in the quarterfinal setting up a mouth-watering match against neighbors India. Though Bangladesh failed to put up a fight against India in the quarters, Taskin was once again among the wickets. He picked three wickets and his chest-bump celebration with skipper Mashrafe Mortaza went viral on social media.  <br/>  <br/> The right-arm quickie was an integral part of the ODI team that tasted ODI series victories against Pakistan and India. A rib injury meant that Taskin had to miss out on the home series against South Africa. He was back for the Asia Cup 2016 held in Bangladesh, where Taskin Ahmed was consistently economical that helped his team reach the final which they eventually lost to India.  <br/>  <br/> In 2016, Taskin was a main member of Bangladesh's contingent to India for the ICC World T20. But, disaster struck Bangladesh's camp when he and Arafat Sunny were banned from bowling as their bowling actions were found to be illegal. He was sent back home and Bangladesh couldn't win a single match in the Group 10 stage.  <br/>  <br/> He reassessed his bowling action at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane and all his deliveries were found to be legal. He was immediately selected for the home ODIs against Afghanistan and  later against England where he found his rhythm back.  <br/>  <br/> He was drafted into the Test squad and made his debut against New Zealand in January 2017. Kane Williamson was his first Test victim. He generates sufficient pace that can trouble even the best in the business. He has seen ups and downs in his young career. With the age being on his plus side, he could certainly end up as one of Bangladesh's best bowlers. <br/>  <br/> <b>By Abhinand Raghavendran</b>",

      "bio": "Mehidy Hasan had a Test fifer even before turning 19. Born in Khulna, his parents wanted him to excel in studies. But, Mehidy had different ideas and chose cricket over academics. His talent was first discovered by former Bangladeshi off-spinner Sheikh Salahuddin. Mehidy captained Bangladesh in the Under-19 World Cup in 2014 at the age of 16 and made his first-class debut for Khulna against Rajshahi Division in February 2015.  <br/>  <br/> It was in 2016, when Mehidy Hasan grabbed headlines. It started with the U-19 World Cup in Bangladesh, where he led his country for the second time. His all-round performances helped his team finish third and he was named the player of the tournament. Soon, he had a tremendous first-class season. He finished the season with 30 wickets at an average of 16.43. These performances earned him a maiden international call-up for the two-match Test series against Alastair Cook's England.  <br/>  <br/> Mehidy made his Test debut in October 2016 at Chittagong. His first spell with the new ball lasted ten overs that accounted for two wickets. Being one day old in the Test arena, he had a five-wicket haul against his name and he eventually finished with figures of 6/80. Bangladesh lost that Test by a close margin of 22 runs, but that had no effect on the youngster. He bettered his performance by notching up two more six-wicket hauls in the second Test at Dhaka which helped Bangladesh beat England for the very first time in the longest format. He was named the Man of the Match as well as the Man of the Series.  <br/>  <br/> In the 2016 edition of the Bangladesh Premier League, he represented Rajshahi Kings who finished runners-up. Away from home, in alien conditions in New Zealand, Mehidy managed to take just four wickets in two Tests. In the one-off Test at Hyderabad against India, he registered his maiden Test fifty against the likes of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. <br/>  <br/> 2017 was a memorable year for Bangladesh in Test cricket as they notched up their first ever wins over Sri Lanka (away) and Australia at home. Both the series ended as draws and Mehidy played a crucial role in both of those campaigns. His unerring accuracy is his biggest strength, particularly on tracks that help the spinners. Like most Bangladeshis, he also had a forgettable South African tour where he played just the one Test without a single wicket despite bowling more than 65 overs in the match. <br/> By now, it was clear that Mehidy’s career trajectory was going only one way and that was upwards. He picked up his maiden five-wicket haul in a Test series against the West Indies and later in the series, registered the best match figures by a Bangladeshi bowler by picking up 12/117. And right throughout, his batting was improving as well. He played several crucial knocks and bailed Bangladesh out of tricky situations. A maiden Test ton came in 2021 against the West Indies as well.  <br/>  <br/> Mehidy was able to translate his great form in red ball cricket to white ball cricket as well. He became a vital cog in Bangladesh’s lineup and in May 2021, even climbed up to No. 2 in the ICC’s ODI Bowling rankings. His maiden ODI ton, a 100* off 83,  came in another crunch situation as he led his team to a win over India to seal a bilateral series played in late 2022. His all-round abilities have meant that he’s been an integral part of Bangladesh’s setup across formats.  <br/>  <br/> <b>By Abhinand Raghavendran and Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "Born in Satkhira, Soumya Sarkar wanted to become a teacher like his father. But thanks to his cricketing talent and BKSP - the country’s biggest sports institute, he took up a career in cricket instead. He played two Under-19 World Cups - 2010 and 2012 and the latter fetched him headlines when he ran Australia’s Jimmy Peirson, who left his crease too early, out at the bowler’s end in a high-stakes quarterfinal clash against Australia in Townsville.  <br/>  <br/> An elegant batsman and a more-than-decent medium-pace bowler, Sarkar made his first-class debut for Khulna Division in the 2010-11 season. He made his ODI debut in the final game of the home series against Zimbabwe in December 2014, where he scored 20 off 18 balls batting at No. 3.  <br/>  <br/> He was an integral part of the impressive Bangladesh set-up that defeated Pakistan, India and South Africa at home in successive series. He notched up 497 runs overall in the combined nine matches against those three strong opponents, which involved three half centuries and an unbeaten ton (133) against Pakistan. His scores of 27, 88* and 90 against the likes of Morne Morkel, Rabada, Morris and Tahir earned him the Man of the Series award.  <br/>  <br/> The selectors showed faith in the then 21-year old and selected him for the 2015 ICC World Cup in Australia just a couple of months after his ODI debut. Although he had just one international game against his name, in six innings he scored 175 runs in the mega tournament. In 5 of the 6 games, Sarkar got off to starts but converted only one of them into a fifty. Bangladesh made a historic run into the quarters of the 2015 WC courtesy the all-round batting performance from the squad. <br/>  <br/> Sarkar made his debut in the longest format against Pakistan on April 28th 2015, where he scored 33 in either innings. On the back of a couple of failures, he was dropped from the Test team. Injury to Imrul Kayes allowed Sarkar to make a comeback in the five-day format against New Zealand at Christchurch in 2017. His score of 86 in the first essay earned him a regular place in the playing eleven. The away Test series against Sri Lanka was by far his best series. He recorded three successive fifties in the two-match series which was tied 1-1. His 61 at P Sara Oval was a very important knock that helped his team win its 100th Test match - a historic match.  <br/>  <br/> After a pile of low scores in the 50-over format, Sarkar returned back to form in the ODI tri-series held in Ireland, featuring the hosts and New Zealand in May 2017, where Bangladesh went past Sri Lanka in ODI rankings to reach the sixth spot. He couldn’t hold on to that form for very long though and was plagued by inconsistency. He kept bouncing in and out of the squad in the years that followed and failed to nail down his spot. As other top-order batters like Najmul Hussain Shanto and Tanzid Hasan emerged, Sarkar found himself pushed down the order. Although not a regular member of the playing XI, Sarkar remained a constant part of Bangladesh’s squad across formats.  <br/>  <br/> <b>Some less known facts about Soumya Sarkar:</b> <br/>  <br/> - To emulate his childhood idols Brian Lara and Sourav Ganguly, Soumya Sarkar, primarily a right-hander switched to bat left-handed.  <br/> - He holds the joint record for the most number of catches taken in a World Cup match - 4 (with Mohammad Kaif and Umar Akmal).   <br/> - He is the fastest Bangladeshi player to score 2000 runs in ODIs  <br/> - His 169 v NZ is the highest ODI score by a Bangladeshi away from home <br/>  <br/> By - <b>Abhinand Raghavendran, Kumar Abhisekh Das & Anurag Hegde </b>",

He hit the headlines at a very young age, when he struck a double-century in a one-day match at the school level. The southpaw was selected for the Under-19 World Cup, 2014 at the age of 15. In the 2015 season, he registered his maiden first-class century playing for Rajshahi Division.  <br/>  <br/> It was in the year 2016 when Nazmul Hussain's career started to blossom. It started with the Under-19 World Cup which was held in his home country - Bangladesh - where he received back-to-back man of the match awards against South Africa and Scotland. He aggregated 259 runs which helped his team finish third in the tournament. In the same year, he was picked by the then defending champions Comilla Victorians for the fourth edition of the Bangladesh Premier League. He scored a fifty on his debut game against the likes of Tymal Mills, Taskin and Mohammad Nabi. <br/>  <br/> In November 2016, Shanto was chosen by the selectors for a preparatory camp held in Sydney, ahead of the national team's tour to New Zealand. Nazmul was added to the Bangladesh's Test squad following an injury to Mominul Haque on the eve of the second Test against the Kiwis. He made his debut in Christchurch, where all he managed was scores of 18 and 12. He was dropped for the next assignment - the one-off Test match against India in Hyderabad.",

      "bio": "One of the greatest T20 bowlers in the world, and the biggest name to come out of Afghanistan cricket, Rashid Khan's meteoric rise has been a story of hope and inspiration for his countrymen in difficult times. <br/>   <br/> Marketing leg-spin's modern face with chic, Rashid outnumbers legbreaks with googlies, something he has perfected into a reliable and somewhat retaliatory weapon, and executes it without being ever so predictable. Having doted on Shahid Afridi's modus operandi since childhood, Rashid bowls similar lines - linear, from stump to stump - and does so at quick pace, rebelliously using his fingers more than the wrists, thus not allowing the batsman any time to shimmy out and get to the pitch of the ball. As much as his visible profile may belie, Rashid is also an agile fielder who is well capable of putting in the dives, and then excels at clearing the big ropes in the slog overs to top it all.  <br/>   <br/> Spin to the right. Spin to the left. Skid on straight. You are never quite sure of what Rashid Khan is gonna serve. Labelled as a legspinner, Rashid has a rainbow of variations in his bowling armoury and has been the most-sought bowler, since his debut, in leagues all around the globe. Interestingly, a lot of batsmen struggle to pick his variations as he barely alters his arm-speed while delivering the ball. In February 2017, Rashid fetched the highest IPL bid for any Associate nation player ever, eventually having been bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad for INR 4 crore at the same auction that abandoned world's top-ranked limited-overs bowler Imran Tahir, 38 then, red-faced with no bids whatsoever.  <br/>   <br/> Rashid soon became a vital cog in Sunrisers' line-up and his ability to bowl at any stage during the game made him almost indispensable in the side. A gun fielder, he proved his batting and catching credentials in the 2018 edition and made quite a few headlines for grabbing a one-handed stunner at the Chinnaswamy stadium in Bengaluru to dismiss Colin de Grandhomme near the boundary ropes. In his five years with the Sunrisers, he took 93 wickets and went at an economy rate of 6.33. In 2022, he was picked up by Gujarat Titans and played an instrumental role in their title-winning campaign. <br/>  <br/> His achievements on the international stage have been no less impressive. Making his debut at the age of just 17, Rashid soon became the quickest to 100 ODI wickets, and also the quickest to 100 T20I wickets. In a short Test career, he has already bowled Afghanistan to victories against Ireland, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.",

      "bio": "Sylhet Royals, Quetta Gladiators, Sunrises Hyderabad, St.Kitts and Nevis Patriots, Melbourne Renegades et al. Don't be surprised when you find the link between all these teams. Yes, it is Mohammad Nabi. From gully cricket as a 10-year-old to the finest of grounds all over the world. Nabi has conquered most of them.  <br/>   <br/> Afghanistan struggles every day to cope up with life. Cricket like many other countries is not only a form of entertainment but a national hope. A hope of a new dawn. And Nabi has been the torchbearer of it since 2009. As an offie, Nabi can tease you with his loopy ones and wreck you with his quicker darts. As a fielder he is safe as a house. And as a batter, he can be destructive on his day.  <br/>   <br/> Be it their first win in World Cups against Scotland in 2015 or their triumph against the eventual champions Windies in the 2016 T20 World Cup, Nabi was there. Even Gayle did the Gangnam dance after Afghanistan's win, Nabi was there. He slips into roles that you want him to. A quintessential all-rounder with supreme abilities. Fittingly, he became the first Afghan cricketer to be picked up by an IPL team. <br/> On a tour to India in the 2000s, he was noticed by Mike Gatting when he hit a ton against the visiting MCC side. He later went on to play for the MCC, making his first-Class debut with them. Nabi rose to fame when he took 11 wickets in the 2009 ICC World Cricket League Division Three, helping Afghanistan to progress to the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier. After Afghanistan gained ODI status in that tournament, Nabi made 58 in his debut game against Scotland.  <br/>   <br/> In Afghanistan's debut First-Class match during the Intercontinental Cup, Nabi made 102 in their first innings against Zimbabwe XI. In the next year, Nabi made his T20I debut in February 2010 against Ireland. Later that year Nabi was named as the Afghanistan captain for the Asian Games but Nawroz Mangal was restored back to the position soon after the tournament.  <br/>   <br/> Nabi played for the Afghan Cheetahs team which competed in the Faysal Bank T20 Cup in Pakistan in 2011-12. In 2013, Nabi turned up for the Bangladesh Premier League side Sylhet Royals and helped his team reach the semi-finals with some splendid performances. He took 16 wickets in 13 games and was one of the top batsmen in the tournament.  <br/>   <br/> Nabi led Afghanistan's successful campaign in the 2014 Asia Cup when they defeated Bangladesh, their first win over a Test playing nation. Although that was the only victory they achieved in the tournament, the country won many hearts across the world with a gritty show. He was also chosen to lead the side during the 2015 World Cup as well. Since then the Afghanistan juggernaut with Nabi as one of the wheels has gained more pace with them being awarded Test status by the ICC.",

      "bio": "Unlike the stereotypical Afghan success story involving war-stricken and plagued backgrounds, Mujeeb Ur Rahman's is the trend-breaker. Having grown up in a mansion in Khost, Mujeeb developed a keen interest in cricket while watching the 2012 World T20.  <br/>  <br/> Blessed with his own private practicing facilities, Mujeeb discovered his aptitude for spin bowling trying to squeeze a tennis ball between his fingers to bowl off-breaks and carom balls. Over time, Mujeeb started to develop some strength and could propel the ball further with a flick of the finger. The millennial spinner was also helped by Youtube videos of Ajantha Mendis and started to attend his first cousin's (Noor Ali Zadran) cricket academy to hone his skills.  <br/>  <br/> WIth a plethora of difficult-to-decipher variations, he rose through the ranks to represent Afghanistan at the highest level at the tender age of 16. As Rashid Khan's apprentice in the team, the hype around him has been handled rather well by the teenager and has been backed up by some spell-binding performances by the prodigy.  <br/>  <br/> Mujeeb played a vital role in thrashing Bangladesh 3-1 in their own backyard, in one of his first international assignments. His peak in youth cricket came during a spell of 7/19, defending a paltry total of 133 and exhibited his ability to perform in pressure situations. Mujeeb ended the landmark series picking up a record 17 wickets in the tournament, and this was just the beginning. <br/>  <br/> An Asia Cup performance that included 20 wickets in 5 games, including game-changing performances in the semi-final and final signaled his arrival in international cricket. A ravaging performance against Ireland in the ODI series in December 2017, and some brilliant performances in the U-19 World Cup, including a 4-for to knock out hosts New Zealand in the quarter-final.  Moreover, with Afghanistan being awarded Test status, this is the perfect platform for Mujeeb to etch his name in history as one of the first greats for Afghanistan as a full member.  <br/>  <br/> He may have been a 17-year-old with a four-crore INR deal, from a war-torn nation which had thus far produced only two IPL players, but Mujeeb was clearly unfazed by the enormity of what he'd achieved. KXIP's think-tank too seemed to have placed a lot of trust in the youngster in 2018, who despite the presence of several international stars, made it to the first eleven, thus becoming the youngest ever to play in the IPL, and played a crucial role in his side's victories in the first half of the season. This included bamboozling many a batsman, including Virat Kohli, and he was more than happy to bowl the tough overs in the match, towards the death and in the powerplay.  <br/>  <br/> Adding to the records, Mujeeb also became the first player born in the 21st century to play Test cricket when he made his debut against India in Afghanistan's inaugural Test match in 2018. Incidentally, the his Test debut was also his first-class debut.  <br/>  <br/> Mujeeb not only firmly established himself as a vital cog for Afghanistan across formats but also proved to be a valuable asset for the various franchises he represented around the globe. Tournaments he's played in include the IPL, PSL, BPL, BBL, CPL, LPL and The Hundred amongst others.  <br/>  <br/> Ajantha Mendis might not be a household name anymore but the species made famous by him still find habitats to survive. Mujeeb belongs to the 'mystery' spinner species. His strength is his nagging accuracy and of course the judicious use of carrom ball. Mysteries can be solved but this one is here to stay for a long time. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Rishi Roy and Kumar Abhisekh Das</b> <br/> ",

      "bio": "Rahmanullah Gurbaz has risen through the ranks to become one of Afghanistan's key batters in limited overs cricket. Famous wicketkeeper Mohammad Shahzad's replacement, Gurbaz was quick to make an impression in the international arena in 2019. Batting at the top of the order, his aggressive brand of cricket suited T20 cricket. But the wicketkeeper-batter has always wanted to be  an all-format player. <br/>   <br/> Afghanistan needed stability in their batting department, especially in the top-order. Gurbaz and his team-mate from his junior days - Ibrahim Zadran - have been able to provide that. In 2021, Gurbaz became the first-ever Afghanistan batter to notch up a ton on ODI debut. Initially known for his boundary-hitting skills, Gurbaz has learned the art of playing the waiting game as well which has helped him negotiate some tough spells against the new ball. He's a quick runner between the wickets and also competent with the gloves behind the sticks. <br/>   <br/> He raised two centuries apiece in 2022 and 2023 in the ODIs and made significant contributions in Afghanistan's win over England and Pakistan during the 2023 World Cup. In the same year, he also recorded his maiden T20I hundred. Afghanistan entered the semifinal of the 2024 T20 World Cup and Gurbaz played a vital role in it as he ended up as the leading run-getter of the tournament.  <br/>  <br/> Currently, he holds the record for the most ODI centuries scored by an Afghanistan player. Gurbaz is an asset to have for any team and has tasted success in franchise cricket having played in various T20 leagues around the world.",

      "bio": "One of the youngest to notch up a Test match fifty in his debut game, Ibrahim Zadran’s performance in the second innings was pivotal for Afghanistan who nailed their second-ever Test match win by demolishing Bangladesh at the latter’s den. A compact opening batsman with plenty of grit, gumption and spunk, Ibrahim has been a consistent performer in his brief domestic career thus far back in Afghanistan. With averages in the 40s both in First-class and List A, and with Afghanistan facing opening concerns (especially after Shahzad’s controversial exit), Ibrahim’s chance had to come and the way he has started gives promise for a team that’s still in its early days in Test cricket. Of course, he isn’t a finished product by any means and is quite raw but his temperament is a quality that should hold him in good stead for the future. Ibrahim turns 18 in December 2019 and based on potential, seems here to stay, at least in the longest format of the game. <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>",

      "bio": "Hazratullah Zazai, in his brief career, is known for one stupendous innings - a 162 off 62 balls, the highest in a T20I, in Dehradun in February 2019 against Ireland. This was an innings of such extraordinary carnage, that it made him a household name in the cricketing fraternity overnight. In a country known for its spinners, and more spinners, Zazai was a welcome addition to the batting line-up so that the exemplary spinners had larger targets to defend. <br/>  <br/> He set the world stage alight when he smashed six sixes in an over in the Afghanistan Premier League, playing for Kabul Zwanan against Balkh Legends in Sharjah. A broad, bulky southpaw, Zazai has a Hayden-esque presence at the wicket, and showed signs of a precocious prodigy as a teenager in a T20I series against Ireland, culminating in a fiery 82 to seal the series. He had already made an identity for himself with a 44-ball hundred in the APL, but the six sixes record, paired with Yuvraj Singh's 12-ball fifty record (both in the same game, 12 years apart) certainly sent his stock soaring into orbit.   <br/>  <br/> In February 2019, he put the EA Cricket '07 players to shame, as he smoked a 62-ball 162* against Ireland in the third T20I at Dehradun. He smoked 16 sixes to carry Afghanistan to a massive total of 278 - also a world record. The sample space is still too small to draw a judgement, but Zazai is a likely contender for the upcoming World Cup in England, given that he could give Shahzad company at the top of the order to make for a formidable opening pair going forward.  <br/>  <br/> What to expect in the 2019 WC? <br/>  <br/> An explosive left-hander, Zazai has all the traits of being the massive weapon that Afghanistan would want to unleash on their opponents. His partnership with Mohammad Shahzad will be another crucial factor that will decide their team's fate. The burly southpaw has an arc, an area which the bowlers would want to stay away from. Anything in his radar will disappear. Hardly someone who has any inhibitions, he might well have to curtail his instincts a bit if the new ball moves a bit. But if the English wickets are flat then this man can plunder runs at the pace of knots! <br/>  <br/> Relatively, new to the international scene and that might add to his advantage as he won't have any baggage of failures. His success or failure might be directly be proportional to Afghanistan's report card in the tournament. <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Rishi Roy and Kumar Abhisekh Das</b>",

      "bio": "Born in Sialkot, Pakistan, Sikandar Raza's dream of being a fighter pilot ended prematurely when he failed in his eye examination. Nursing the dream from a tender age of 11, it was not easy for Raza to see his dream being shattered in such a way.\r <br/> \r <br/> Determined to succeed in his life, Raza got admitted to the Glasgow Caledonian University and moved to Zimbabwe, where his parents had resided since 2002. He began playing cricket as a semi-professional and made his First-Class debut in 2007 for the Northerns. After Zimbabwe's cricket structure was revamped in 2009, he went on to play First-Class cricket for the Mashonaland Eagles.\r <br/> \r <br/> After completing his studies, he returned to full-time cricket in the 2010-11 season. He had a decent season, scoring 625 runs at an average of 41. He made his Twenty20 debut for the Southern Rocks in 2010 against the Desert Vipers. He turned out to be a T20 specialist, and he was the leading run-scorer in the 2010 Stanbic Bank 20 Competition.\r <br/> \r <br/> It did not take long for the selectors to recognise his talent and was selected to play in a practice match against Bangladesh when Vusi Sibanda was injured. He did well and Zimbabwe cricket expedited the process of granting him citizenship status. He was named in the preliminary squad for Zimbabwe's 2011 Cricket World Cup campaign, but did not make it to the final squad. He was granted citizenship status in late 2011.\r <br/> \r <br/> After putting up consistent performances for the next two years, Raza was awarded with the ODI cap in May 2013, thus fulfilling his dream of playing in Zimbabwe colours. His first game was against Bangladesh, but he was not able to do well in that match. His finest performance in the format came when he hit his first fifty and that too against India in his fourth game. His well-measured 82 against a strong Indian bowling attack helped Zimbabwe post a decent total. He also made his debut in T20Is in the series against Bangladesh.\r <br/> \r <br/> Raza made his Test debut in September 2013 against his home country - Pakistan in the first of a two-match series after Brendan Taylor decided to sit out. He performed well, hitting a fifty in the first innings but was omitted for the second game after Taylor came back into the squad.\r <br/> \r <br/> Raza has made most of the opportunities he has got. The tour of Bangladesh in 2014 was a very good one for him. In the three matches, Raza scored three fifties and cemented his place in the side as an opener. He has also not done badly in ODIs, even though he has scored only one hundred and one fifty so far, he has given plenty of starts. Raza was a key member of the squad that had been selected for the 2015 World Cup.\r <br/> \r <br/> Since then, he was in and out of the side. Raza's major break came in 2017; He was one of the linchpins in Zimbabwe's first ever bilateral ODI series victory over Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka where he contributed with both bat and ball. A few days later, the all-rounder followed that up by cracking his maiden Test century in the one-off Test against the same opponent. However, Zimbabwe went onto to lose the Test, Raza's 127 made the selectors sit back and notice his performance.\r <br/> \r <br/> Raza was the Player of the Tournament in the 2019 World Cup Qualifiers, having scored 319 runs and picked 15 wickets. However, despite his best efforts Zimbabwe could not qualify for the World Cup in England due to a change in format which made it a 10 team tournament. Following this failure to qualify for the World Cup, the Zimbabwe Cricket Board took some harsh calls by dropping several senior players including Sikandar Raza. \r <br/> \r <br/> In April 2021, Raza suffered a serious health scare with a bone marrow infection which was initially thought to be cancerous. However, fortunately that wasn’t the case and he made a full recovery, returning to competitive cricket after four months. It was as though Raza found a second wind on his comeback, and was man of the series in a remarkable home series win in ODIs and T20Is over Bangladesh. \r <br/> \r <br/> He was also the Player of the Tournament in the T20I World Cup Qualifiers for 2022, almost single-handedly punching Zimbabwe’s ticket for Australia. Raza was one of the talismanic performers at that World Cup as well, as Zimbabwe got through the group stages and got an iconic win over Pakistan as well. \r <br/> \r <br/> Sikandar Raza also greatly worked and improved on his bowling at this time, developing a mean carrom ball to his repertoire of variations. He also took on the responsibility of bowling at the death for Zimbabwe, embellishing his reputation as a proper all-rounder. \r <br/> \r <br/> With this renaissance in form, Sikandar Raza became hot property for franchise teams all over the world. He was picked by Dubai Capitals in the inaugural ILT20 league, and also played an integral role for Lahore Qalandars who won the PSL in 2023. Sikandar Raza was picked by Punjab Kings for the 2023 IPL - his first opportunity in this tournament. He made a few handy contributions with the bat in the limited opportunities he got for Punjab Kings in 2023 IPL.\r <br/> \r <br/> Raza is a man for the big occasions and Zimbabwe would be hoping that their talisman comes to the fore in the ODI World Cup Qualifiers for 2023. He is at the peak of his game and will be eager to produce something special for his country. ",

      "bio": "Among the many cricketers, who got their chance after the rebel Zimbabwean players protested against the board in 2004, Brendan Taylor was probably the most talented to come through. He was drafted into the side as a young 18-year-old batsman and made his ODI debut against the visiting Sri Lankans in April, 2004. He failed in the first four matches, but showed glimpses of his talent with a knock of 74 in the final game. He followed it up with consecutive half-centuries against Australia in the next month and by then, it was clear that Taylor was one for the future.  <br/>  <br/> While the talent was indisputable, questions about his temperament lingered on, as Taylor was guilty of getting starts and throwing it away in an attempt to be aggressive. Now and then, he would show signs of a mature head on his shoulders, but wasn't consistent enough.  <br/>  <br/> Taylor was a part of the Zimbabwe World Cup squad in 2007, but failed to impress. However, in the same year when the ICC launched the T20 World Cup, Taylor helped Zimbabwe stun 50-over Champions Australia in a league match. Taylor, anchored the chase of 139 with a fine knock and ended up with an unbeaten 60 off 45 balls to take Zimbabwe home.  <br/>  <br/> Apart from being a batsman and a useful part-time spinner, Taylor also kept wickets in the absence of Tatenda Taibu. Despite being consistent with the bat, Taylor had to wait until 2009 for his maiden ODI century. He struck an unbeaten 118 against Bangladesh, but it went in vain as Bangladesh clinched a one-wicket victory. <br/>  <br/> In the next one year, he started converting his starts and went on to score centuries against top teams like Sri Lanka and South Africa, the latter being a majestic unbeaten 145. He played in the 2011 World Cup and scored 80 against Sri Lanka in a league match. He was named the captain of the side after the World Cup. When Zimbabwe returned to the Test fold after a long gap, Taylor scored 176 in the one-off match against Bangladesh, including a second innings hundred, becoming only the second Zimbabwean to score a century in his first match as captain. Soon after, in the ODI series against New Zealand in 2011, Taylor showed fantastic form and became the first Zimbabwean to score back-to-back ODI tons. This form continued in the Tests that followed.  <br/>  <br/> Since Zimbabwe's return to Tests, Taylor has shown maturity in all forms of cricket. He led Zimbabwe by example, contributing to some of their most important wins. Taylor was contracted to play for Wellington as an overseas player in New Zealand's HRV T20 Cup in December 2011. Although Wellington finished at the bottom, Taylor was the side's leading scorer with 207 runs and eleventh best overall.  <br/>  <br/> In 2013, he was signed by the Chittagong Kings for $30,000. Taylor was again one of their best scorers and after Mahmudullah resigned as the captain, Taylor took over the reins. Taylor was the team's leading scorer and 3rd in the league with 316 runs. Taylor gave up the ODI and T20I captaincy in August 2014 to Elton Chigumbura as the board wanted to try the split captaincy theory. After giving up the leadership role, Taylor's batting has been on a downwards spiral. He had a mediocre tri-series against South Africa and Australia and didn't play to his potential in Bangladesh as well. <br/>  <br/> He broke millions of Zimbabwean hearts with his decision to turn Kolpak at the end of the 2015 World Cup, and that too after he smashed two sparkling back-to-back tons against Ireland and India. His 433 runs in the tournament gave him the record for the most runs by his countrymen in any edition. He was only 29, certainly with the best years of his career ahead of him.  <br/>  <br/> He however cited financial reasons for his move out of Zimbabwe. He turned down the central contract and announced his retirement as well from Zimbabwean cricket with a move headed to Nottinghamshire. His county stint was pretty inconsistent to start off with. Not just poor form. Taylor had to fight poor behaviour on his part as well, quite like the incident when he fell asleep in his car during the post match celebrations of the Royal London semi-finals in 2015.  <br/>  <br/> In September 2017, he announced a move back to his homeland and made himself available to play international cricket for Zimbabwe, giving them a major boost ahead of their preparations for the 2019 World Cup, where they'd have to qualify to make it to the main draft. He was also picked by the Stellenbosch Kings in the newest league coming out, the Global T20 League.",

      "bio": "Sean Williams is a reliable batter and a more than useful left-arm spinner for Zimbabwe. He made everyone sit up and take notice when he was one of the stand-out players in the 2004 Under-19 World Cup by performing consistently with bat and ball. When the Zimbabwean players strike happened in 2004, Williams was widely expected to be given a call to the national side. His father, Colin Williams, however refused to send his son, suggesting that let him concentrate on studies. <br/>  <br/> He made his debut in 2005 when Zimbabwe toured South Africa, making only 12 in a losing cause. He was also selected and made captain of the Under-19 side for the World Cup, where he led his team to a surprise win over England. There were rumours that Williams had differences with the board and the rumours were confirmed soon as he rejected a central contract. <br/>  <br/> He was part of the Zimbabwe squad for the World Cup in the subcontinent in 2011 but was forced to fly home for recovery due to a fractured thumb. He made his Test debut against West Indies in March 2013. <br/>  <br/> Williams was recalled to the Test side when Zimbabwe took on South Africa in the one-off Test. He didn't do much in the game, scoring only 24 and three. However, he was back to his best in the subsequent tri-series which featured South Africa and Australia. He scored a couple of crucial fifties against the Proteas and took seven wickets, he was also part of the team that pulled off an upset win over Australia. <br/>  <br/> Williams had a dispute with the-then head coach, Stephen Mangongo, and was dropped from the tour of Bangladesh in October-November 2014. However, with Dav Whatmore being named as the head coach, Williams was recalled to the side and was part of the 2015 World Cup squad. Williams starred in Zimbabwe’s World Cup 2015 Pool B game against UAE. He scored an unbeaten 76 to help his side get over the line by 4 wickets. Later in the tournament, in a do-or-die game against Ireland, Williams made a solid 96 but got out at a crunch situation when Zimbabwe needed 32 runs off 19 deliveries. Eventually, Zimbabwe failed to win that game as they fell short by 5 runs and their World Cup hopes ended in a devastating way. <br/>  <br/> Williams showed what he is capable of in his comeback Test match against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016. He was battling through a flu but he showed great character and resolve to carry on and scored his maiden Test ton. It was only his third Test match and Williams notched up the quickest Test ton by a Zimbabwean off only 106 balls. Although Zimbabwe slumped to an innings defeat, William’s stoic knock proved that a positive mindset and grit can do wonders for you. <br/>  <br/> Williams has also scored the fasted ODI ton by a Zimbabwean batter and it came off only 75 deliveries. That knock came in a match against UAE in Harare in April, 2019. Over the years, Williams has grown into an efficient all-rounder for Zimbabwe in all three formats of the game. The reverse-sweep is one of his favourite shots and he employs it to great effect. He also bowls probing lines and lengths and his changes of pace are not easy to deal with for the batters.  <br/> \t <br/> In September 2019, Williams was handed over the T20I captaincy for Zimbabwe. He captained Zimbabwe for the first time in T20Is in a tri-series involving Nepal and hosts Singapore in September-October 2019. Although Zimbabwe lost a game against Singapore, they eventually went on to win the tri-series. Willliams won the Player of the Match award in two of their four games. Soon after that, Williams was named the Test captain in January, 2020 and his first assignment involved leading Zimbabwe in a 2-match home Test series against Sri Lanka. Williams scored his second Test ton on the first day of the second Harare Test.  <br/>  <br/> In March 2021, Zimbabwe squared off against Afghanistan in a 2-match away Test series. Williams led from the front with the bat in that series and scored two centuries and a half century in three innings. Williams was awarded the Player of the Series for his gutsy performances with the bat. He certainly thrived with the bat under pressure and seemed to enjoy the responsibility.  <br/>  <br/> Sean Williams has seen a number of highs and lows in his ongoing international career. He has battled through injuries and has had issues with the Zimbabwe cricket board on and off. Williams has captained Zimbabwe in all three formats and that is an appreciable achievement. He has produced numerous special knocks and some match-defining performances with the ball as well. Although Williams no longer leads Zimbabwe in any format, the hunger to do something special for his country as a player is still there. The 2023 ODI World Cup Qualifiers might be the perfect stage for Williams to produce something memorable for his country.  <br/> ",

      "bio": "Brother of Sean Ervine, Craig Ervine, hails from a family with strong cricketing roots - his father and uncle both played First-Class cricket and his younger brother Ryan has turned out for the Southern Rocks franchise.  <br/>  <br/> Spells with English clubs Bexhill and Lordhood, and a spell with Irish club Lisburn in Belfast ensured that he got sufficient match practice and he returned to Zimbabwe, and signed up for the Southern Rocks. He was their leading run-scorer with 575 runs at 33.82 and topped their ODI run charts as well.  <br/>  <br/> He was selected for the 2010 T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and soon made his ODI debut against India in the same year. A talented middle-order batsman, Ervine like his brother, is a solid accumulator of runs. He relies on placing the ball in the gaps and runs hard between the wickets. Ervine had a pretty good 2011 World Cup, but despite his efforts, his side couldn't reach the knock-out stages of the competition.  <br/>  <br/> He also featured in the 2012 T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka but failed to make much of an impact. Just like any other Zimbabwe cricketer, Craig Ervine's career has suffered several bouts of inconsistency.  <br/>  <br/> Ervine chose to leave Zimbabwe in 2013, citing financial insecurity, and secured an Irish passport using his great grandfather’s connection. He played for Northern Knights - an Irish franchise team, and then had a stint at Perth where he tried his hand at club cricket in Australia.  <br/>  <br/> However, Ervine made himself available for selection for Zimbabwe once again ahead of the 2015 World Cup, and was picked for that tournament. He was the third highest run getter for Zimbabwe in WC 2015 and scored a crucial 42 against UAE in what was their only win of the tournament.  <br/>  <br/> Ervine has since been a constant feature of the Zimbabwe side, playing all formats. In 2017, Ervine’s crowning moment in whites arrived as he scored a superb century at the R Premadasa Stadium, but despite that Zimbabwe couldn’t win that match.  <br/> Having become a senior member of the side, Ervine was handed over captaincy in February 2020, firstly in Tests where he captained in a one off game against Bangladesh. In 2021, he was handed over the reins of limited overs captaincy as well, taking over from Sean Williams.   <br/>  <br/> Interesting fact: Ervine suffered a freak accident when he was in his early teens. He slipped and fell on a piece of broken glass and it required a three hour corrective surgery on his right hand. Initial diagnosis suggested an amputation, but thankfully that wasn't required. ",

      "bio": "Blessing Muzarabani is armed with natural pace and bounce and is regarded as one of the best fast bowling talents to emerge from the country in the last decade. He has a gift of height and delivers the ball at a height greater than Morne Morkel.  At a young age of 21, he can clock 135-140 and is already the quickest bowler in the Zimbabwean circuit.  <br/>  <br/> By playing only a handful of matches, Muzarabani has come up the ranks very early. Muzarabani made his Test debut against South Africa in the historical four-day pink ball Test and clearly the inexperience showed as he returned wicket less on a pitch that had lateral movement as well as bounce. Zimbabwe were hammered inside two days and so was the confidence of Muzarabani.   <br/>  <br/> In his ODI debut against Bangladesh he bowled four no-balls in a row which brought down the expectations of Heath Streak and the team management from him. But make no mistake, he has all the raw materials to become one of the finest fast bowlers Zimbabwe has ever produced. But for that to happen the potential has to be transformed into perseverance and then into performance.  <br/>  <br/> He is often being termed as a replica of Kagiso Rabada in the Zimbabwean domestic circuit and if his first couple of years in the International cricket are anywhere close to Kagiso Rabada's then Zimbabwe cricket will be served excellently.     <br/>  <br/> Despite these high expectations, Muzarabani couldn’t make his early opportunities with Zimbabwe count. In 2018, he made himself unable for selection for Zimbabwe and signed with Northamptonshire as a Kolpak player. In his first season for Northamptonshire, he took 17 wickets at an average of just under 28 in 7 first class appearances. Due to the rule changes regarding Kolpak players, Muzarabani’s county stint was cut short and returned to Zimbabwe in 2020.  <br/>  <br/> Blessing Muzarabani was picked for the home series against Pakistan in November, 2020 and rewarded his inclusion by picking a five wicket haul in one of the ODIs. Since then, Muzarabani has been a regular feature in Zimbabwe’s white ball setup, and has remains an intimidating figure with his 6ft8 intimidating figure and extra pace.  <br/>  <br/> Apart from Internationals, Muzarabani has made a name for himself in franchise cricket. He was picked as a replacement player for Obed McCoy by Multan Sultans in the 2021 PSL season, and returned 10 wickets in 6 games as his franchise won the title. He was also picked as a net bowler for the 2022 IPL season by Lucknow Super Giants.  <br/> ",

      "bio": "A right-handed opening batsman, Paul Stirling, has been known for providing attacking starts to Ireland in the 50-over and Twenty20 version of the game. With Ireland having gained Test status, Stirling now has the opportunity to fine tune his game plan to effectively counter the needs of red-ball cricket. It shouldn't be too tough for him, considering his immense experience in the English domestic set-up, having been part of Middlesex for several years now.  <br/>  <br/> A decade into international cricket, Stirling has grown from a chubby 18-year old debutante to becoming the linchpin of Ireland's batting order. As part of the Associate nations, Stirling racked up runs for fun against similar opposition, but he also showed that he had the game against the big boys. The 2011 World Cup was a disappointment though - as he managed only one score of significance - 101 coming against Netherlands in Kolkata. He shrugged off the disappointment though and registered his first hundred against a visiting Test nation, against Pakistan, in May 2011. Since then, he has grown in stature and has been regarded as one of the finest batsman ever produced by Ireland. <br/>  <br/> Numbers tell the story for Stirling, in 97 ODIs, he has 50+ scores in 23 innings - getting him a ratio that will stand proud amongst the best opening batsmen of this era. He however has a tendency of being a nervous starter - nine ducks in 97 games is perhaps one glaring stat which needs to be worked on. With his country getting recognized as a regular Test playing nation, the onus will be on the likes of Stirling to ensure that the next generation of Ireland cricketers have a stable platform.  <br/> ",

On his debut, Tector had scores of 10 & 22 against Leinster Lightning and also claimed three wickets in the same match with his handy off-breaks. Tector was named as the rising star of Ireland's squad following the 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup wherein he took 8 wickets and emerged as the leading wicket-taker in the tournament. <br/>  <br/> One of Harry's recent prolific performances came against Sri Lanka A where the youngster played a superb knock of 103 when his team was in trouble but unfortunately ended on the losing side as the opposition chased down a competitive target of 269 within 31 overs and made it appear like a stroll in the park. Tector's batting average in the limited-over formats is far better as compared to first-class cricket and he was also named in Ireland's T20I squad for the Oman Quadrangular Series in addition to the series against Afghanistan recently. The youngster didn't get a chance to feature in the playing XI but with age by his side and talent to showcase he'll soon be seen in Irish colors at the international level.",

      "bio": "Joshua Little, in contrast to his name, is a tall left-arm fast bowler who plays for the Ireland national team. Born in 1999, the pacer is still a teenager and has a long career ahead of him, and certainly has the pace to bother the best batsmen around the world. A bowler who relies on early swing in the air, and is also capable of extracting subtle movement off the seam, is certainly a raw asset to an aging Irish side.  <br/>  <br/> Little made his List A debut for Leinster Lightning in the 2018 Inter-Provincial Cup in June 2018 and his first-class debut for Leinster Lightning as well, later in the same month. He made his T20I debut against Hong Kong on the 5th of September 2016. Little was a little older than 16 at the time of his debut, making him the second-youngest to have played at the international level, after Waqas Khan of Hong Kong.  <br/>  <br/> Little's talent tempted the selectors to pick him for the U-19 World Cup in 2016. He was also included in Ireland's T20I squad for the series against Afghanistan in India in March 2017 but had to pull out of it owing to the need to write an exam. In December 2017, he was named in Ireland's squad for the 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup and played the pace spearhead throughout the tournament for Ireland. <br/>  <br/>  In January 2019, he was named in Ireland's T20I and ODI squads against Afghanistan in Dehradun, India. With age on his side, and Ireland having just been introduced as a Test nation, the future seems very bright for Little if he is able to maintain his fitness with sustained performances over the years.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Rishi Roy</b>",

      "bio": "In the age of the wristspinner, Sandeep Lamichhanne from Nepal is another exponent of the art who has played a part in reviving it from the dead after the retirement of Shane Warne. The catchy name did the rounds through the IPL 2018 auctions as he made history by becoming the first Nepali cricketer to play the world’s most lucrative league. <br/>  <br/> After a dizzying auction for the teenager, he was signed by the Delhi Daredevils franchise for INR 2 million for the 11th edition of the league. Sandeep was spotted by the talent scouts during the annual Hong Kong T20 sixes in 2017 and was summoned for a trial against the big boys, so as to assess his strengths. Clearly, he was good enough to make the cut… <br/>  <br/> The 17-year old was also a key member of the Nepal side which tried its fortunes at the 2019 World Cup qualifiers. Michael Clarke also helped the young man to play Grade cricket in Australia in late 2016 after he was spotted by the former Australian captain in Hong Kong. He turned up for Western Suburbs of Sydney and gained exposure to the domestic club cricket scene in Australia, playing under the guidance of Clarke, Shane Warne, and several other greats.  <br/>  <br/> After a successful U-19 World T20 campaign in 2016, when he took 14 wickets including a 5-for against the clueless Irish batsmen, Lamichhane shone bright in the WCL Championship as well, and once again, in 2018, did well in the Division two tournament, ending up as the man of the tournament of the event in Namibia, lifting his nation to the World Cup qualifiers for the second time in history.  <br/>  <br/> Shortly after his 18th birthday, the millennial started off playing his first CPL season, and was mildly successful in the first half of the tournament for St. Kitts, and continues to be a vital cog in the wicket-hungry T20 era. A clever bowler far beyond his years with world-beating variations and disguises, Lamichhanne is definitely one for the future.  <br/>  <br/> Written by <b>Rishi Roy</b>",

      "bio": "If he were playing for any established nations, Ryan would have been a household name thanks to his pyrotechnics. A superb all-rounder, Ryan can be a ballistic striker with the bat, bowls right arm medium fast that surprises the batsmen and is a competent fielder. <br/>  <br/> Ten Doeschate was discovered by Essex when they went on a pre-season tour of South Africa. His all-round abilities for Western Province caught their eyes. He is qualified to play county cricket by virtue of holding an EU citizenship. Ryan averages an impressive 67 in ODI cricket, the best amongst the present day batsmen. His average is a bit skewed as Netherlands rarely get an opportunity to play the big boys of cricket. <br/>  <br/> A T20 freelancer, Ryan has played in almost all cricketing nations displaying his immense talent. He represents the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. He was retained by the Kolkata team during the 2014 IPL auctions. <br/>  <br/> It is no wonder that Ryan has been described as the best associate player amongst all the non-Test playing nations. ten Doeschate  made a splash in the 2011 ICC WC scoring 2 centuries. One of them was against the highly rated English team, a fine career best knock of 119. This was also his first ever century against a Test playing nation.  <br/>  <br/> Despite not having a regular dose of international cricket, Ryan remains one of the most committed players for Netherlands and will hope to sustain his already impressive track record. However, Ten Doeschate had a fall out with the team management before the 2014 T20 WC, after which he opted not to play and decided to play domestic cricket in New Zealand during the same period. <br/>  <br/> Ten Doeschate over the captain’s armband in both the 50 and 20 over versions of the game from James Foster for the 2014 season for Essex. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Pradeep Krishnamurthy</b> <br/> <i>As of April 2014</i>",
